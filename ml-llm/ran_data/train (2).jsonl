{"input": "Which of the following environmental factors does NOT lower the pH of soil? A. Acid rain B. Use of fertilizers C. Weathering of minerals D. Mine spoils E. All of these choices can possibly lower the pH of soil.", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)When atmospheric water reacts with sulfur and nitrogen compounds that result from industrial processes, the result can be the formation of sulfuric (H2SO4) and nitric (HNO3) acid in rainwater. However, the amount of acidity that is deposited in rainwater is much less, on average, than that created through agricultural activities. Acid soils are most often found in areas of high rainfall. Additionally, rainwater has a slightly acidic pH of 5.7 due to a reaction with CO2in the atmosphere that forms carbonic acid. Ammonium (NH4+) fertilizers react in the soil in a process called nitrification to form nitrate (NO3-), and, in the process, they release H+ions. Highly weathered soils are often characterized by high concentrations of Fe and Al oxides.  Severely acidic conditions can form in soils near mine spoils due to the oxidation of pyrite also known as iron sulfide (FeS2). In addition to the choices listed, potential acid sulfate soils naturally formed in waterlogged coastal and estuarine environments can become highly acidic when drained or excavated, and decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms can release carbon dioxide (CO2), which can form carbonic acid (H2CO3) when mixed with soil water."}
{"input": "Which of the types of soil listed below contains the highest amount of nutrients? A. Clay B. Silt C. Sand D. Gravel E. Loam", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)Loam is soil composed of sand, silt, and clay in relatively even concentrations.

{"input": "Which factor is the most important in determining the characteristics of soil? A. Topography B. Climate C. The type of bedrock D. The type of vegetation that is growing E. Time for the soil to develop", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: (B)Climate is the major factor in determining the kind of plant and animal life on and in the soil. It determines the amount of water available for weathering minerals, transporting the minerals, and releasing elements. Climate, through its influence on soil temperature, determines the rate of chemical weathering. Warm, moist climates encourage rapid plant growth and thus high organic matter production. The opposite is true for cold, dry climates. Organic matter decomposition is also accelerated in warm, moist climates. Climate controls freezing, thawing, wetting, and drying, which break parent material apart. Rainfall causes leaching. Rain dissolves some minerals, such as carbonates, and transports them deeper into the soil. Some acidic soils have developed from parent materials that originally contained limestone. Rainfall can also be acidic, especially downwind from industrial processes."}
{"input": "A soil sample was analyzed and found to contain 30% clay, 60% sand, and 10% silt. Using the soil texture chart below, this soil would be classified as A. clay B. sandy loam C. clay loam D. sandy clay loam E. loamy sand", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: (D)Begin by going up the left diagonal of the triangle (percent clay) until you reach 30% (draw a horizontal line); at that point is one of the intercept lines. Now, at the bottom of the triangle, find the 60% sand line (follow the diagonal line); that is your second intercept line. Where the two lines meet is the sandy clay loam area. You do not need to use the percent silt information—only two of the percentages are necessary."}
{"input": "Weathering contributes to the formation of which type of rock? A. Igneous B. Metamorphic C. Sedimentary D. Volcanic E. None of the above", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)Sedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer over a crust consisting mainly of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral and/or organic particles (detritus) to settle and accumulate or minerals to precipitate from a solution. Particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment. Before being deposited, sediment was formed by weathering and erosion and then transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice, mass movement, or glaciers. Examples of sedimentary rocks include chalk, limestone, sandstone, clay, and shale."}
{"input": "A rock that would most likely contain a fossil would be A. igneous B. metamorphic C. sedimentary D. volcanic E. All of the above", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)Sedimentary rock is formed by the piling of material over time.

One hundred times", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)The Richter scale is a log10scale and measures the magnitude of an earthquake. 5 - 3 =2and 102= 100. However, the Richter scale does NOT measure the energy of an earthquake. The energy of a Richter magnitude 5 has 32 times more energy than a Richter magnitude of 4."}
{"input": "Most StableLeast StableABedrockSandBUnconsolidated sandBedrockCClayBedrockDSand and mudClayEWater-saturated sandSand A. A B. B C. C D. D E. E", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Soil type can substantially increase earthquake risk. The worst soils to build upon include deep, loose sand; silty clays; sand and gravel; and soft, saturated granular soils. Earthquake forces are amplified on water-saturated soils, changing the soil from a solid to a liquid, a process known as liquefaction. Liquefaction makes the ground incapable of supporting a foundation. During liquefaction, the ground can crack or heave, causing uneven settling or building collapse. The best soils to build upon to reduce damage from earthquakes are bedrock (deep and unbroken rock formations) and stiff soils. These soil types are best, since much less vibration is transferred through the foundation to the structure above."}

{"input": "A low-pressure air mass is generally associated with A. hot, humid weather B. fair weather C. tornadoes D. cloudy or stormy weather E. hurricanes", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: (D)A low-pressure air mass (low) occurs when warm air, which is less dense than cooler air, spirals inward toward the center of a low-pressure area. Since the center of the low-pressure area is of even less density and pressure, the air in this section rises and the warm air cools as it expands. The temperature begins to fall and may go below the dew point—the point at which air condenses into water droplets. These water droplets make up clouds. If the droplets begin to coalesce on condensation nuclei, rain follows."}

Moist air from the ocean rises when it hits mountains, cools, and loses its moisture on the windward side. On the leeward side, air is much drier. For example, the western side of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range in California is much wetter than the eastern side."}
{"input": "The ozone layer exists primarily in what section of the atmosphere? A. Troposphere B. Stratosphere C. Mesosphere D. Thermosphere E. Ionosphere", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: (B)97% of ozone (O3) is found in the lower stratosphere, which is 9 to 35 miles (15-55 km) above Earth's surface. Temperature increases with altitude in the stratosphere due to absorption of heat energy by ozone molecules."}
{"input": "Along the equator, A. warm, moist air rises B. warm, moist air descends C. warm, dry air descends D. cool, dry air descends E. cool, moist air descends", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Hadley cells occur between 0° and 25° north and south latitudes (equatorial region). In this area, there is upward air motion, cooling of the air due to uplift, high humidity, high clouds, and heavy rains."}
{"input": "Most of Earth's deserts are at approximately 30° north and south latitudes because these latitudes are characterized by A. generally warm ocean currents B. predominately low atmospheric pressure C. descending dry air currents D. a slow-moving jet stream E. enhanced solar radiation", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)Deserts are arid regions defined by the amount of rainfall an area receives in a year (less than 10 inches [approximately 25 cm]),notby temperature. Deserts are often hot, but dry; cold places, such as Antarctica, qualify as deserts too. Since there is more direct sunlight at the equator, warm air rises and begins to cool. Since the rising cooler air holds less water than warmer air, precipitation is common at the equator (e.g., tropical rainforests). This drier air mass then moves both north and south. At around ±30 degrees north and south latitudes, the dry air begins to sink and warm. The warmer air can now hold more water, resulting in the evaporation of water and the formation of deserts."}
{"input": "Characteristics or requirements of a monsoon include all of the following EXCEPT A. a seasonal reversal of wind patterns B. large land areas cut off from continental air masses by mountain ranges and surrounded by large bodies of water C. different heating and cooling rates between the ocean and the continent D. extremely heavy rainfall E. heating and cooling rates between the oceans and the continents that are equal", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)During monsoon season, winds blow from cooler ocean areas (higher pressure) to warmer landmasses (lower pressure). As the air rises over the landmasses, it cools and is unable to retain water, producing great amounts of precipitation. In winter, the ocean is now warmer and the cycle reverses. Drier air travels from the land out to the ocean. Monsoons exist in Australia, Africa, and North and South America."}
{"input": "An atmospheric condition in which the air temperature rises with increasing altitude, holding surface air down and preventing dispersion of pollutants, is known as (a) A. temperature inversion B. cold front C. warm front D. global warming E. upwelling", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Temperature inversions are atmospheric conditions in which the air temperature rises with increasing altitude, holding surface air down and preventing the dispersion of pollutants."}
{"input": "The surface with the lowest albedo is A. snow B. ocean water C. forest D. desert E. black topsoil", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)Albedo is a measure of reflection of sunlight from a surface.

{"input": "Areas of low pressure are typically characterized by __________ air and move toward regions where the pressure is _________ with time. A. sinking, falling B. rising, falling C. sinking, rising D. rising, rising E. non-moving, changing", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: (B)In a high-pressure system, air pressure is greater than the surrounding areas. This difference in air pressure results in wind. In a high-pressure area, air is denser than in areas of lower pressure. The result is that air will move from the high-pressure area to an area of lower pressure. Clear skies and fair weather usually occur in these regions. On the other hand, winds tend to blow into a low-pressure system because air moves from areas of higher pressure into areas of lower pressure. As winds blow into a low-pressure system, the air moves up. This upward flow of air can cause clouds, strong winds, and precipitation to form."}
{"input": "The global circulation pattern that dominates the tropics is called the A. Ferrel cell B. Polar cell C. Bradley cell D. Hadley cell E. Tropical cell", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: (D)Hadley cells dominate the tropics."}
{"input": "Which of the following statements about sea and land breezes is FALSE? A. Sea breezes can sometimes result in rain showers and thunderstorms near the shore. B. Smaller versions of sea/land breezes often form in the vicinity of large lakes. C. Land breezes form mostly during the daytime hours. D. Sea and land breezes are examples of thermal circulations. E. All of these statements are false.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)A sea breeze, or onshore breeze, is a gentle wind that develops over bodies of water near land due to differences in air pressure created by their differences in heat capacity and associated rates of heating and cooling. It is a common occurrence along coasts during the morning as solar radiation heats the land more quickly than the water. A land breeze, or offshore breeze, is the reverse effect, caused by land cooling more quickly than water in the evening. The sea breeze dissipates and the wind flows from the land toward the sea. Both are important factors in coastal regions' prevailing winds and more moderate temperature profile."}

After that, it expands slightly until it reaches the freezing point, and then when it freezes, it expands by approximately 9%."}
{"input": "What type of relationship exists between the legislation that proposes to subsidize farmers for growing water-thirsty crops and water demand? A. A positive feedback loop B. A negative feedback loop C. A synergistic relationship D. An inverse relationship E. A mutualistic relationship", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Positive feedback loops enhance or amplify changes, tending to move a system away from its equilibrium state and make it more unstable. Negative feedback loops tend to dampen or buffer changes, which tends to hold a system to some equilibrium state, making it more stable. In this case, legislation that makes it easier or more cost-effective to use water for thirsty crops would increase the demand for water."}

{"input": "Saltwater intrusion into groundwater occurs most often when A. the water table near the coast drops due to the over-pumping of groundwater B. surface salts from irrigation water seep into the ground C. storms at sea create unusually low tides D. less surface water reaches the water table E. saltwater is pumped into aquifers to replenish water tables", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Normally, the groundwater underlying coastal regions has an upper layer of freshwater with saltwater beneath it. The layering occurs because rain, falling as freshwater, is less dense than saltwater. When freshwater is withdrawn at a faster rate than it can be replenished, a drawdown of the water table occurs, with a resulting decrease in the overall hydrostatic pressure. When this happens near an ocean coastal area, saltwater from the ocean intrudes into the freshwater aquifer."}

{"input": "Which would be least likely to be affected by a density-dependent limiting factor? A. A small, scattered population B. A population with a high birth rate C. A large, dense population D. A population with a high immigration rate E. None of the above", "output": "Correct Answer: ( Explanation: (A)Increasing population size reduces available resources, thus limiting population growth. In restricting population growth, a density-dependent factor intensifies as the population size increases, affecting each individual more strongly. Population growth declines because of death rate increase, birth rate decrease, or both. There is a reduction in the food supply, which restricts reproduction resulting in less offspring. The competition for space to establish territories is a behavioral mechanism that may restrict population growth. Predators concentrate in areas where there is a high concentration of prey. As long as the natural resources are available in sufficient quantity, the population will remain constant. As the population decreases, so do predators. The accumulation of toxic wastes may also limit the size of a population. Intrinsic factors may play a role in limiting a population size. High densities may cause stress syndromes, resulting in hormonal changes that may delay the onset of reproduction. It has also been reported that immune disorders are related to stress in high densely populated areas. Density-independent factors include weather, climate, and natural disasters such as freezes, seasonal changes, hurricanes, and fires.

None of the above are correct.", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: (D)Solar energy that is absorbed by ozone molecules and is partly turned into heat creates a warm region in the stratosphere which creates a stable air mass that resists sinking and mixing with the lower atmosphere, effectively forming a barrier. In the ozone layer, temperature increases with height, creating a stable and buoyant air mass that keeps an effective lid on the lower atmosphere."}
{"input": "As a molecule, bromine is about 40 times more damaging to the ozone layer than chlorine. Under the Montreal Protocol, methyl bromide in developing countries was phased out in 2005. What was methyl bromide used for? A. Sterilizing soil in fields and greenhouses B. Killing pests on fruits, vegetables, and grain before export C. Fumigating soils D. Killing termites in buildings E. All of the above", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)Methyl bromide (CH3Br), also known as bromomethane, originates from both natural and human sources. In the ocean, marine organisms are estimated to produce approximately 62,000 tons (approximately 56,000 m.t.) annually. Methyl bromide is banned by the Montreal Protocol, but it has continued to receive \"critical use\" exemptions from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to be used as a soil fumigant (primarily in strawberry fields) to prevent spoilage during storage. This exemption for U.S. agricultural use does not have a specified end date. The amount of methyl bromide allowed for critical uses in the United States has declined from approximately 8,000 tons (7,500 m.t.) in 2005 to approximately 400 tons (approximately 375 m.t.) in 2015."}

{"input": "True statements about global warming include which of the following? A. I only B. II only C. I and II D. III only E. All of these choices are false.", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)Earth's primitive forests first appeared around 300 million years ago during the Carboniferous Period. Before then, the atmosphere held far more CO2but concentrations declined throughout the Carboniferous Period (359 to 299 million years ago during the late Paleozoic Era) as plants flourished and absorbed more and more CO2from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, creating carbon sinks (coal, oil, etc.). During the Carboniferous Period, the atmosphere became greatly depleted of CO2(declining from about 2,500 ppm to 350 ppm) so that by the end of the Carboniferous Period the atmosphere was less favorable to plant life and plant growth slowed. Today, CO2concentrations are approximately 380 ppm (0.038% of our atmosphere). The Arctic is feeling the effects of increases in average global air temperatures the most with average temperatures in Alaska, western Canada, and eastern Russia rising at twice the rate of the global average."}
{"input": "One of the reasons why the vortex winds in the Antarctic are important in the formation of the hole in the ozone layer is A. they prevent warm, ozone-rich air from mixing with cold, ozone-depleted air B. they quickly mix ozone-depleted air with ozone-rich air C. they harbor vast quantities of N2O D. they bring in moist, warm air, which accelerates the ozone-forming process E. None of the above", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Ozone depletion follows an annual cycle that corresponds to the amount of light that reaches the Antarctic. The cycle begins every year around June when vortex winds develop in the Antarctic. Cold temperatures produced by these winds create polar stratospheric clouds that capture floating chlorofluoro-carbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting compounds. For the next two months, a reaction occurs on the cloud surface that frees the chlorine in the CFCs but keeps it contained within the vortex. In September, sunlight returns to the Antarctic and triggers a chemical reaction, causing chlorine to convert ozone to oxygen gas. November brings a breakdown in the vortex and allows the ozone-rich air to combine with the thinning ozone. Wind currents carry this mixture over the Southern Hemisphere."}
{"input": "Although the Montreal Protocol curtailed production of ozone-depleting substances, the peak concentration of chemicals in the stratosphere is only now being reached. When do scientists expect a recovery in the ozone levels in the stratosphere to occur? A. Immediately B. Within 5 years C. Within 20 years D. Within 50 years E. In about 100 years", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)Concentrations of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have leveled off in the stratosphere and have actually begun to decline in the lower atmosphere. A CFC molecule can take about 8 years after being released at ground level to reach the stratosphere. Decades may pass until it is converted by sunlight into a form that depletes ozone."}

{"input": "Which of the following is NOT an effect caused by increased levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching Earth? A. Warming of the stratosphere B. Cooling of the stratosphere C. Increased genetic damage D. Reduction in immunity E. Reduction in plant productivity", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)The stratosphere has been cooling over the past three decades. The stratosphere contains the ozone layer, which absorbs sunlight and heats the stratosphere. This long-term cooling trend is generally accepted to result from the loss of the ozone layer as a result of human-made influences. However, the cooling trend is not uniform like ozone loss but, rather, broken into a series of jumps or discontinuities most likely associated with major volcanic eruptions that inject aerosols into the stratosphere. The aerosols also absorb sunlight and heat from the stratosphere, thus temporarily offsetting the cooling trend from ozone loss."}

E", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)Environmental resistance or limiting factors consists of all factors in an environment that limit a population's ability to increase in numbers. Predation, competition for resources, disease, limited food and space, etc., all work to hold a population in check. Environmental resistance can be either density-dependent or density-independent. Factors that are density-dependent are stronger when a population has a higher density (more crowded). Examples would include predation, parasitism, disease, and competition for space or food. Density-independent factors (usually abiotic) will kill organisms—whether they are crowded or not. Examples would include floods, storms, earthquakes, fire, etc. In nature, biotic potential and environmental resistance work together to level out population numbers to an amount that can be supported by the environment.

The relationship indicated by the graph is one of predator-prey. The coyotes prey upon rabbits, keeping the population in check."}
{"input": "If the interrelationship of rabbits and coyotes was once in balance, what is the most probable explanation for the decline of the coyotes? A. Mutations B. Starvation C. Disease D. Increase in reproductive rate E. Removal by human beings", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)The most probable explanation for the decline of the coyotes is removal by humans. Since the decline in coyotes occurred with cattle introduction and since cattle and coyotes do not compete for the same food, the individuals that introduced the cattle must have interfered with the coyote population. Because coyotes are predators, they were likely perceived as dangerous to the cattle and were likely hunted and poisoned by humans. Attempts to control coyotes by poisoning may deplete the numbers of their natural prey and lead to increasing attacks by coyotes on farm animals."}
{"input": "Which of the climatograms represents a savanna? A. 1 B. 2 C. 3 D. 5 E. 6", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Savannas are warm year-round with a prolonged dry season and scattered trees. The environment is intermediate between grassland and forest. Savannas consist of grasslands with stands of deciduous shrubs and trees that do not grow more than 30 meters high.

{"input": "How does the great ocean conveyor belt moderate Earth's climate? A. I only B. II only C. III only D. I and II E. II and III", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: (B)The great ocean conveyor belt transfers warm water from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic as a shallow current and returns cold water from the Atlantic to the Pacific as a deep current that flows farther south. As it passes Europe, the surface water evaporates and the ocean water cools, releasing heat to the atmosphere. This release of heat is largely responsible for the relatively warm temperatures enjoyed by western Europe. As the water becomes colder, it increases in salinity and becomes dense, sinking thousands of feet below the surface. The deep water slowly travels south through the oceanic abyss, eventually mixing upward to the surface in different parts of the world up to 1,000 years later."}

It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere approximately 8-12 miles (13-20 km) above Earth, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically."}
{"input": "This region is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface. A. A B. B C. C D. D E. E", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)The troposphere begins at the surface of Earth and extends to about 4 miles (7 km) at the poles to approximately 11 miles (17 km) at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest, and temperature decreases with altitude, promoting vertical mixing. The troposphere contains approximately 80% of the mass of the atmosphere."}
{"input": "Stratospheric ozone depletion is most likely to result in which of the following? A. Higher crop yields due to higher amounts of sunlight B. Disruption of photosynthesis in plants C. Increased movement of the human population away from areas influenced by the hole in the ozone D. Less clouds in the sky E. Warmer temperatures", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: (B)Stratospheric ozone depletion describes two distinct but related phenomena observed since the late 1970s: a steady decline of about 4% per decade in the total volume of ozone in Earth's stratosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone over Earth's polar regions (\"ozone hole\"). Effects of decreases in stratospheric ozone that result in increased UV radiation reaching Earth include: (1) reduction in the growth and population of phytoplankton; (2) damage to DNA of phytoplankton; (3) reduced numbers of phytoplankton, so less krill is available for higher-order consumers; (4) reduction in leaf growth and surface area; and (5) decrease in photosynthetic activity."}
{"input": "Viability is the capacity of living organisms to live, develop, or germinate under favorable conditions. Which of the following factors decreases a population's viability? A. I only B. II only C. III only D. I and III E. II and III", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Organisms that live in specialized niches are not adapted to a wide range of environmental circumstances and food sources. An example of an animal living in a specialized niche would be the koala, which lives in eucalyptus trees and exclusively consumes eucalyptus leaves. Should anything affect the eucalyptus trees, the viability of the koala population is threatened. The advantage of living in a specialized niche is that there is little interspecific competition for the same resource."}

{"input": "You have been placed in charge of rebuilding a salmon population in a river basin that contains a hydroelectric dam. Which of the following remediation techniques would NOT be effective? A. Reduce silt runoff B. Build fish ladders C. Decrease water flow from the dam D. Release juvenile salmon from hatcheries E. Use trucks and barges to transport salmon around the dam", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)Dams create a series of lakes, slowing the current and delaying downstream migration. The delay interferes with internal biological changes that enable the young salmon to survive in saltwater. In addition, the slow water exposes them to predators and disease. To increase salmon populations, one should release extra water from dams to wash juvenile salmon downstream."}
{"input": "Which one of the following proposals would NOT increase the sustainability of ocean fisheries management? A. Establish fishing quotas based on past harvests B. Set quotas for fisheries well below their estimated maximum sustainable yields C. Sharply reduce fishing subsidies D. Shift the burden of proof to the fishing industry to show that their operations are sustainable E. Strengthen integrated coastal management programs", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Today, 3 million fishing boats operate and are greatly depleting the supply of fish and other aquatic life-forms. Over the past 40 years, fishing quotas have more than tripled. In 1950, 20 million tons of fish and marine products were harvested. By 1990, this amount had increased to 100 million tons per year. The depletion of fish stocks has led to overfishing in all oceans and other bodies of water. Past catches were generally higher than those of today due to overfishing. Therefore, to base today's harvest limits on harvest numbers that were probably higher in the past would only accelerate the depletion of current fishing stocks."}

{"input": "Smog levels in large, urban cities are generally highest during the A. summer B. spring C. fall D. winter E. The season or time of year does not matter.", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Smog is a type of air pollution that is derived from vehicular emissions from internal-combustion engines and industrial fumes that react in the atmosphere with sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog. It is produced by the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere. Air pollutants produced during the formation of photochemical smog can include nitrogen oxides (NOx), peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs), ozone, and volatile organic compounds, all of which are usually highly reactive and oxidizing. It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles. Because it travels with the wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well. Since there is more sunlight during the summer, photochemical smog is more common during the summer months."}
{"input": "In general, parasites tend to A. become more virulent as they live within the host B. destroy the host completely C. become deactivated as they live within the host D. be only mildly pathogenic E. require large amounts of oxygen", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: (D)Virulence is the harm that parasites and diseases cause to their host. Parasite virulence is, in general, proportional to the degree that the parasite exploits the host. Parasite offspring are produced by exploiting the host; therefore, some virulence is inevitable. However, too-strong host exploitation leads to high virulence that jeopardizes survival of the host and the parasite itself. Thus, there should be an optimal level of host exploitation and virulence by the parasite."}
{"input": "The population of a country in 1994 was 200 million. Its rate of growth was 1.2%. Assuming that the rate of growth remains unchanged and all other factors remain constant, in what year will the population of the country reach 400 million? A. 2020 B. 2024 C. 2040 D. 2054 E. 2104", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: (D)To find the doubling time of a population at any given annual rate of growth, divide 72 by the annual growth rate (in this case 1.2): 72 ÷ 1.2 = 60 years. 1994 + 60 = 2054."}
{"input": "Which of the following contributes LEAST to acid deposition? A. Sulfur dioxide B. Ammonia C. Nitrogen oxides D. Lead E. All of the above contribute equally to acid deposition.", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: (D)Sulfur dioxide (SO2) leads to the formation of sulfuric and sulfurous acid. Ammonia (NH3), although a base, does form the ammonium ion (NH4+) which can react with sulfates and nitrates, forming slightly acidic ammonium salt particles (ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate), which can enter water supplies or the soil. Nitrogen oxides can form nitrous and nitric acid. Lead does not contribute to acid deposition."}
{"input": "The circulation of air in Hadley cells results in A. low pressure and rainfall at the equator B. high pressure and rainfall at the equator C. low pressure and dry conditions at about 30° north and south of the equator D. high pressure and wet conditions at about 30° north and south of the equator E. both (A) and (C)", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Large-scale circulations develop in Earth's atmosphere due to uneven heating of its surface by the sun's rays. Daytime solar heating is greatest near Earth's equator, where incoming sunlight is nearly perpendicular to the ground. The heated air near the equator expands and rises and creates low pressure at the equator. Air cools as it rises, causing water vapor to condense (rain) as the air cools with increasing altitude. As an air mass cools, it increases in density and descends back to the surface in the subtropics, creating high pressure."}

{"input": "The largest contaminant (by weight and volume) of inland surface waters such as lakes, rivers, and streams in the United States is A. sediment B. organic wastes C. pathogenic organisms D. heavy metals E. oil", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Sediment is the largest contaminant of surface water by weight and volume in the United States, and is identified as the leading pollution problem in rivers and streams and the fourth leading problem in lakes. Sediment in surface water is largely a result of soil erosion, which is influenced by soil properties and agricultural practices. Sediment buildup reduces the useful life of reservoirs, can clog irrigation canals, block navigation channels, and increase dredging costs. By raising streambeds and burying streamside wetlands, sediment increases the probability and severity of floods. Suspended sediment can increase the cost of water treatment for municipal and industrial water uses and can also destroy or degrade aquatic wildlife habitat, reducing diversity and damaging commercial and recreational fisheries."}

{"input": "In which of the following pairs of items would biodiversity be more likely to be LESS in the first area than in the second? A. Savanna, taiga B. Large lake, small lake C. Temperate area, the Arctic D. Temperate area, tropical area E. Intertidal zone, benthic zone", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: (D)Biodiversity is the degree of variation of life-forms with a given species, ecosystem, or biome and is a measure of the health of ecosystems. In terrestrial habitats, tropical and temperate regions typically support a large variety of different species whereas polar regions with climatic conditions not being optimal for producers, support fewer species. Biodiversity is not evenly distributed; rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things (biota) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, soils, geography, and the presence of other species. Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the poles to the tropics. Thus, localities at lower latitudes have more species than localities at higher latitudes. Tropical areas are areas that support the greatest biodiversity of living organisms on Earth."}

{"input": "Examine the following graph, which shows the predator-prey relationship between hares and lynxes. A. the prey population is controlled by predators alone B. hares and lynxes are so mutually dependent that each species cannot survive without the other C. the relationship is primarily independent; in other words, the number of hares does not have any effect on the number of lynxes and vice versa D. both hare and lynx populations are regulated mainly by abiotic factors E. the hare population is r-selected and the lynx population is K-selected", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: (B)The lynx and hare populations have a predator-prey relationship. Disease, food supply, and other predators are variables in this complex relationship. Every ten years or so, the hares' reproduction rate increases. As more hares are born, they eat more of their food supply. They eat so much food that they are forced to supplement their diet with less desirable and nutritious food. As the hare population grows, the lynx population begins to increase in response. Because there are so many hares, other predators opportunistically begin to hunt them along with the lynxes. The hares' less nutritious and varied diet begins to have an effect; the hares begin to die due to illness and disease and fewer hares are born because there is less food. The hare population begins to go into a steep decline. Therefore, the lynx population also begins to decline. Some lynxes starve and others die due to disease. Both the lynx and hare populations have fewer offspring, and this decrease in population gives the vegetation a chance to recover. Once there is enough vegetation for the hares to begin to increase their population, the whole cycle begins again."}

{"input": "Why is territoriality an adaptive behavior for songbirds maintaining populations at or near their carrying capacity? A. Because songbirds expend a tremendous amount of energy defending territories, they spend less time feeding their young and fledgling mortality increases. B. Only the fittest males defend territories, and they attract the fittest females; therefore, the best genes are conveyed to the next generation. C. Songbird males defend territories commensurate with the size from which they can derive adequate resources for themselves, their mates, and their chicks. D. Many individuals are killed in the ritualistic conflicts that go along with territorial defense. E. Songbirds make improvements to the territories they inhabit so that they can all enjoy larger clutches and successfully fledged chicks.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)The termterritoryrefers to any area that an animal of a particular species consistently defends against members of its own species (and occasionally against animals of different species). Animals that defend territories in this way are referred to as territorial. For a songbird to expend energy defending a territory larger than what is required to derive adequate resources would not be energy-efficient. To defend a territory smaller than what is required to derive adequate resources puts the songbird and her eggs in jeopardy."}
{"input": "Butterflies and moths both feed on flowers. Butterflies feed during the day, and moths feed at night. This is an example of A. r-strategy B. K-strategy C. resource partitioning D. commensalism E. mutualism", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)Coexistence between direct competitors is not possible (i.e., when two species use the same resource in the same way, the stronger competitor will dominate and survive over the other). Resource partitioning is the process whereby similar species exploit the limited resources in an ecological area without one species driving the other into extinction (e.g., one species may forage in the treetops while another forages on the ground). Similar species may evolve traits that allow each to exploit a distinct subset of the same resource, and, through natural selection, each species adopts a pattern of resource usage that isn't competitive."}
{"input": "The LD50(or median lethal dose) is the lethal dose of a toxin, radiation, or pathogen required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified time. If the acute toxicity of compound X is reported as LD50= 5 mg/kg body weight, which of the following statements is always true? A. A 1 mg/kg dose is 100% safe and will not cause death. B. A 2.5 mg/kg dose will kill 50% of the members of the tested population. C. A 5 mg/kg dose will kill 50% of the members of the tested population. D. A 10 mg dose will kill 100% of the members of the tested population. E. Any dose of compound X will kill at least half of the tested population.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)Median lethal dose (LD50) figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance's acute toxicity (i.e., the lower the LD50, the greater the toxicity). (A) is incorrect because no amount can ever claim to be 100% safe. (B) is wrong because a 5 mg/kg, not a 2.5 mg/kg, dose will kill 50% of the members of the tested population. (D) is incorrect because the dosage needs to be worded as 10 mgper kg. Furthermore, the dosages are not usually directly proportional; hence, lethality due to the amount of the dose administered is often seen as a curve, not as a straight line. Finally, (E) is incorrect because there is no information provided in the question that refers to \"any dose.\" Also, (E) is contrary to the fact that LD50= 5 mg/kg."}
{"input": "Which of the following organisms listed below would be MOST at risk for accumulating fat soluble pesticides? A. Aquatic plants B. Cattle C. Hawks D. Protozoa E. Bees", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)Of the organisms listed, the hawks occupy the highest trophic level as carnivorous consumers. Biomagnification is the increase in the concentration of a substance that occurs in a food chain. Lipid, (lipophilic) or fat soluble substances, cannot be diluted, broken down, or excreted in urine, a water-based medium, and thus accumulate in fatty tissues of an organism. When eaten by another organism, fats are absorbed in the gut, carrying the substance, which then accumulates in the fats of the predator. Since at each level of the food chain there is a lot of energy loss, a predator must continually consume prey, including all of their lipophilic substances."}

CFCs", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)During photosynthesis (CO2+ H2O + sunlight → O2+ C6H12O6), which occurs in the leaves (or needles), atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed (removed from the air) and converted to glucose. When glucose is present in excess, trees and plants store it by using it to synthesize chains of sugar molecules (i.e., starches). Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests to make the land available for other uses."}
{"input": "Heap leaching could be a process used in the extraction of A. copper B. nickel C. gold D. uranium E. All of the above", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)Heap leaching is an industrial mining process that is used to extract copper, nickel, gold, uranium, and other compounds from ore. The advantage of heap leaching is its relatively low operational costs and the ability to extract valuable mineral resources from what otherwise would be low grade ores. The mined ore is usually crushed into small chunks and heaped into a pile where cyanide is used to dissolve the valuable metals. The environmental consequences of the heap leaching processes are cyanide leaks and infiltration of cyanide and other toxins into the water supply. The production of one gold ring through the heap leaching method can generate up to 20 tons of waste material."}
{"input": "After a recent storm, an APES class took a field trip to a storm drain outlet entering the Pacific Ocean at Ballona Creek, in southern California. They carefully collected water samples and brought the samples back to the lab. Alpha group took 100.00 mL of the collected water and filtered it through a 1.2 μm Millipore? glass fiber filter. The filter was carefully transferred to a premassed stainless steel crucible and placed into a 105°C oven for 24 hours. The following is a hypothetical set of data from Alpha group: A. (80.000/100.00) × 100% B. 100.00 – 80.00 C. D. E.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)LetA= weight of crucible + filter + residue after 24 hours at 105°C (mg)LetB= weight of crucible + filter (mg)"}
{"input": "If a plant stores 1,000 units of energy from the sun, and a field mouse eats the plant and is then eaten by a snake, who is then eaten by a bird, who is then eaten by a carnivore, how much of the original 1,000 units of energy will be available to the carnivore? A. 90 B. 9 C. 1 D. 0.9 E. 0.1", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)In a food chain, only about 10% of the energy is transferred from one level to the next. The other 90% is used for respiration, growth, digestion, escaping from predators, maintaining body heat, reproduction, etc. Plant (1,000) → mouse (100 available) → snake (10 available) → bird (1 available) → carnivore (0.1 available)."}
{"input": "Which of the following is an advantage of using green manure? A. I only B. II only C. III only D. I and III E. I, II, and III", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)A green manure is a type of cover crop grown primarily to add nutrients and organic matter to the soil. Typically, a green manure crop is grown for a specific period of time, and then plowed under and incorporated into the soil while green or shortly after flowering. Green manure crops are commonly associated with organic agriculture and are considered essential for annual cropping systems that wish to be sustainable. In addition to the advantages covered in the question, green manures also function in weed suppression and the prevention of soil erosion. Traditionally, the practice of using green manure can be traced back to the fallow cycle of crop rotation, which was used to allow soils to recover."}
{"input": "Which is probably the principal source of nitrates and phosphates? A. The water cycle B. Nitrogen fixation of lighting C. Bacterial decay D. Changes in environmental temperature E. Changes in light intensity", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: (C)Phosphates and nitrates are required for photosynthesis and vary in concentration due to biological activity. In surface waters, where plants are actively involved in the process of photosynthesis, nitrates and phosphates can be in short supply, limiting the amount of biological activity that can take place. The cycling of materials (in this case, nitrates and phosphates) is the function of organisms of decay. Microscopic bacteria in seawater can contain up to 1,000,000 bacterial cells per cubic centimeter."}
{"input": "Ocean water temperatures fluctuate less than air temperatures over land. The primary reason for this phenomenon is A. land absorbs more heat than water B. winds distribute heat that builds up over the land C. there is more water on Earth than land D. the high heat capacity of water E. water both cools down and heats up faster than land", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: (D)Ocean temperatures increase more slowly than land temperatures because of the larger effective heat capacity of the oceans and because the oceans lose more heat by evaporation. Heat capacity tells you how much heat you can put in before the temperature has risen by 1 degree. If something has a large heat capacity, then more heat can be absorbed before it rises in temperature by 1 degree. The heat capacity of ocean water is about four times that of air. Land temperatures have increased about twice as fast as ocean temperatures (0.25°C per decade for land vs. 0.13°C per decade for oceans). The Northern Hemisphere warms faster than the Southern Hemisphere because there is more land in the Northern Hemisphere."}
{"input": "Which of the following pollutants does NOT occur naturally in nature? A. Nitrous oxide B. Radon C. Sulfur dioxide D. Formaldehyde E. All pollutants listed above occur naturally in nature.", "output": "Correct Answer: E Explanation: (E)Nitrous oxide is emitted by bacteria in soils and oceans and has 300 times more impact as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Nitrous oxide is the fourth largest contributor to greenhouse gases ranked behind water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane."}
{"input": "Which of the following sequences correctly lists the different wave arrivals from first to last during an earthquake? A. P waves, then S waves, and then finally surface waves B. Surface waves, then P waves, and then finally S waves C. P waves, then surface waves, and then finally S waves D. S waves, then P waves, and then finally surface waves E. Surface waves, then S waves, and then finally P waves", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Primary waves (P waves) travel faster than other waves through Earth and arrive at seismograph stations first, hence the name \"Primary.\" These waves can travel through any type of material, including fluids, and can travel at nearly twice the speed of S waves. Secondary waves (S waves) arrive at seismograph stations after the faster moving P waves during an earthquake and displace the ground perpendicular to the direction of propagation. S waves can travel only through solids. S waves are about 60% slower than P waves. Surface waves are analogous to water waves and travel along Earth's surface. Because of their low frequency, long duration, and large amplitude, they can be the most destructive type of seismic wave. They are called surface waves because they diminish as they get further from the surface."}
{"input": "Harmful effects of increased UV radiation on Earth's surface include all of the following EXCEPT A. reduction in crop production B. reduction in the growth of phytoplankton and its cumulative effect on food webs C. cooling of the stratosphere D. warming of the stratosphere E. increases in sunburns and damage to the skin", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: (D)The more ozone in a given parcel of the stratosphere, the more heat it retains. Ozone generates heat in the stratosphere, both by absorbing the sun's ultraviolet radiation and by absorbing upwelling infrared radiation from the lower atmosphere (troposphere). Consequently, decreased ozone in the stratosphere results in lower stratospheric temperatures and increased UV radiation reaching the surface of Earth. Over recent decades, the mid to upper stratosphere from 19-31 miles (30-50 km) above Earth's surface has cooled by 2°F to 11°F (1°C to 6°C). This stratospheric cooling has taken place at the same time that greenhouse gas amounts in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) have risen."}
{"input": "Which of the following choices shows the correct order of events that might occur in the process of primary succession? A. Grasses → small bushes → small herbaceous plants → lichen → conifers → long-lived hardwoods → short-lived hardwoods → bare rock B. Bare rock → mosses → grasses → small herbaceous plants → small bushes → conifers → short-lived hardwoods → long-lived hardwoods C. Long-lived hardwoods → short-lived hardwoods → conifers → small bushes → small herbaceous plants → grasses → bare rock D. Bare rock → grasses → mosses → small herbaceous plants → small bushes → conifers → short-lived hardwoods → long-lived hardwoods E. Conifers → bare rock → long-lived hardwoods → small herbaceous plants → lichen → grasses → small bushes → short-lived hardwoods", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: (B)In primary succession, which occurs in virtually a lifeless area (e.g., area below a retreating glacier), pioneer species like lichen, algae, and fungus, as well as other abiotic factors like wind and water, start to change or create conditions better suited for vascular plant growth. These changes include accumulation of organic matter in the litter or humic layer, alteration of soil nutrients, and change in pH or water content of soil. These pioneer plants are then dominated and often replaced by plants better adapted to less austere conditions, such as grasses and shrubs that are able to live in thin, mineral-based soils. The structure of the plants themselves can also alter the community. For example, when larger species like trees mature, they produce shade on the developing forest floor, which tends to exclude light-requiring species allowing shade-tolerant species to invade the area."}
{"input": "Which of the following indoor air pollutants might be found in older ceiling and floor tiles, attic and wall insulation, and pipes used in heating systems? A. Formaldehyde B. Asbestos C. Lead D. PCBs E. Fiberglass", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: (B)The natural fire-resistant property of asbestos makes it ideal for roofing, flooring, and thermal insulation. Asbestos was added to cement to add strength to the material. Homes and apartments built before 1980 are often filled with asbestos, needing only normal wear and tear with age to dislodge the fibers and send them airborne. Asbestos can be found in floor tiles, roofs, furnaces, plumbing, appliances, fireplaces, and window caulking, leaving most everyone vulnerable. Asbestosis is a lung disease that results from the inhalation of asbestos particles. It is marked by severe fibrosis and a high risk of mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the lung)."}
{"input": "Which of the following groups would be most likely to exhibit uniform dispersion? A. Red squirrels, which actively defend territories B. Cattails, which grow primarily at edges of lakes and streams C. Dwarf mistletoes, which parasitize a particular species of forest tree D. Moths in a city at night E. Lake trout, which seek out deep water", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: (A)Uniform distribution means that organisms of a population are generally equally spaced apart. In most situations, a natural uniform dispersion occurs when organisms that comprise a population compete for a common resource. In (A), red squirrels might be found anywhere within their geographic territory, defending it. In (B), cattails would be found clumped in only one area (near the water). In (C), dwarf mistletoes would only be found where a particular species of forest tree is growing. In (D), moths would have a higher density near lighted areas rather than in darker areas, as most moths are attracted by light. In (E), the lake trout would be found more in the deeper areas of the water."}
{"input": "All of the following are correct statements about the regulation of populations EXCEPT A. a logistic equation reflects the effect of density-dependent factors, which can ultimately stabilize a population around the carrying capacity B. density-independent factors have a greater effect as a population's density increases C. high densities in a population may cause physiological changes that inhibit reproduction D. because of the overlapping nature of population-regulating factors, it is often difficult to determine their cause-and-effect relationships precisely E. the occurrence of population cycles in some populations may be the result of crowding or lag times in the response to density-dependent factors", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: (B)A density-independent factor is one where the effect of the factor on the size of the population is independent of and does not depend upon the original density or size of the population. The effect of weather is an example of a density-independent factor. A severe storm and flood coming through an area can just as easily wipe out a large population as a small one."}
{"input": "Which of the following energy sources has the lowest quality? A. High-velocity water flow B. Fuelwood C. Food D. Dispersed geothermal energy E. Saudi Arabian oil deposits", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: (D)High-quality energy is capable of performing a large amount of work, while low-quality energy is capable of performing less work. Energy always changes from high to low quality when work is performed. During the change, some energy is lost in the form of heat, which cannot do work (second law of thermodynamics). The amount of energy lost as heat is often as high as 90% of the total energy involved. The reason that (D) is the correct answer is because of the word \"dispersed.\" Dispersed energy is not concentrated. Therefore, it is of low quality."}
{"input": "Which of the following best explains how clearcutting contributes to climate change on a global scale? A. Clearcutting requires prescribed burning, or setting controlled forest fires to reduce the occurrence of natural fires. B. Clearcutting results in a loss of biodiversity and adds to the problems of endangered species and extinctions. C. Clearcutting involves the burning of cut trees, which releases the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. D. Clearcutting removes plants and their root systems, leading to soil erosion and flooding.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Choices (B), (C), and (D) are all problems associated with clearcutting, while (A) is an unrelated practice, so eliminate (A). Choices (B) and (D), however, are problems not as closely tied to climate change as greenhouse gases, so (C) is the best answer."}
{"input": "Which of the following does NOT result from the melting of polar icecaps? A. Increase in ocean acidification B. Loss of habitat for ice-dwelling species C. Release of the greenhouse gas methane D. Decrease in albedo causing more warming", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The melting of polar icecaps does release methane from inside the ice, so eliminate (C). It certainly causes a loss of habitat for those species who depend on the ice for habitat and food, so eliminate (B). It's also true that melting ice decreases the surface albedo of the region, meaning that less heat from the sun is reflected back to space. This results in a positive feedback cycle and more warming, so eliminate (D). However, ocean acidification is mainly caused by absorption of CO2from the atmosphere by ocean water, and isn't tied to polar melting, so (A) is correct."}
{"input": "The release of stored energy when stress overcomes a locked fault results in which of the following? A. Earthquake B. Volcanic eruption C. Mountain creation D. Hot spot formation", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: When stress overcomes a locked fault, a sudden slip occurs along the fault line: in other words, an earthquake. The other choices are all examples of geological events that can occur along fault lines and plate boundaries but are not caused by stress overcoming locked faults. Choice (A) is correct."}
{"input": "The table below shows the four categories of ecosystem services. A. Agricultural use of former parklands resulting in fewer recreational areas B. Rainforest destruction resulting in the loss of potential medicinal plant species C. Decline in wild bee populations resulting in less pollination and decreased crop yields D. Destruction of wetland habitats for real estate resulting in decreased carbon sequestration", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Loss of areas for recreation represents disruption of a cultural service; fewer pollinators leading to decreased crop yield is an example of the impact of the disruption of a supporting service; and decreasing carbon sequestration interferes with a regulating service. Eliminate (A), (C), and (D). Since the loss of potential medicinal plant species is an example of the disruption of medicinal resources, a provisioning service, (B) is correct."}
{"input": "A. Cyclones B. Hadley cells C. Tradewinds D. El Ni?o–Southern Oscillation", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The Coriolis effect causes deflection in movement of air and water (to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere). This affects large-scale phenomena in the movement of air and water, such as cyclones and hurricanes, as well as Hadley cells and the resulting trade winds. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation is an irregularly periodic variation in winds and sea temperatures caused by a change in the pressure-gradient force over the Pacific Ocean and is not related to the Coriolis effect. Choice (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following is the name for the land area that drains into a particular stream? A. Delta B. Estuary C. Watershed D. Headwaters", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Awatershedis the land area that drains into a particular stream, so (C) is correct. Anestuaryis a part of the wide lower course of a river where its current is met by the tides, whileheadwatersare the source of a river or stream. Adeltais the location where a river drops its sedimentary load as it slows down to meet the ocean."}
{"input": "Which of the following factors limiting human population growth is density-independent? A. Access to clean air and water B. Natural disaster frequency C. Disease transmission D. Food availability", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Access to clean air and water, disease transmission, and food availability all depend on the density of population: with more people shared resources are spread thinner, and disease spreads more easily. However, natural disasters do not occur more frequently depending on the number of people, nor do they affect different numbers of people differently. Choice (B) is correct."}
{"input": "According to the graph, which biome would likely be found in a location with an average annual temperature above 20°C and average annual precipitation below 50 cm? A. Tundra B. Savanna C. Subtropical desert D. Temperate grassland", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The model shows the names of biomes found at different average temperatures and amounts of rainfall. The type of biome found where average temperatures are higher than 20°C and average precipitation is less than 50 cm is subtropical desert, the hottest and driest biome. Choice (C) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following does NOT help explain the relationship between temperature, precipitation, and biome shown in the graph? A. Some vegetation types thrive only in very wet conditions. B. The coldest and hottest temperatures both restrict plant life. C. Drier regions cannot support as great a variety of vegetation as wetter ones can. D. There are temperature extremes in which even the hardiest species cannot grow.", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The relationship between temperature, precipitation, and biome is that, generally, different biomes exist for different ranges of temperature and precipitation. Some biomes are very wet, which (A) supports; some are drier, and have fewer species, as (C) suggests. The coldest and hottest biomes also have fewer species, which makes (B) relevant. However, while it is true that there are temperatures that do not support life, these are not biomes, so (D) does not help explain the relationship shown and is the correct choice."}
{"input": "Which of the following types of vegetation would likely be found in a location with an average annual temperature below 10°C and average annual precipitation above 100 cm? A. Conifer trees, fungi, mosses, lichens B. Shrubs, grasses, herbs, tubers C. Mosses, heath, lichens, algae D. Cacti, succulents, grasses", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The type of biome found where average temperatures are below 10°C and average precipitation is above 100 cm is taiga. Since this biome is generally characterized by conifer trees, with fungi, mosses, and lichens also common, (A) is correct."}
{"input": "Which comparison is valid according to the age-structure diagrams above? A. In 2014 the US had a slower-growing population than Germany did. B. In 2014 Germany had a higher proportion of its population under 45 than the US did. C. In 2014 Germany's population included more people in the 45–49 age range than did the US population. D. In 2014 Germany's population showed negative growth while that of the US showed close to zero growth.", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Use the age-structure pyramids to check the validity of each answer choice. In the year shown, the U.S. had a faster-growing population, so eliminate (A). The U.S. also had a higher proportion of its population under 45: eliminate (B). Be careful with (C): while the relative amount of the population in this age range does look greater on Germany's diagram, the absolute number is much smaller (look at the scales on the two diagrams). Germany's diagram is the classic shape for negative growth, whereas the diagram for the U.S. looks pretty close to what zero growth should look like. Choice (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Based on the information in the diagram above, where is it likely that Germany falls in the Demographic Transition Model? A. Preindustrial State (Phase I) B. Transitional State (Phase II) C. Industrial State (Phase III) D. Postindustrial State (Phase IV)", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Based on the fact that Germany's population already showed negative growth several years ago, you should place Germany solidly in the postindustrial state, so (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Based on the information in the diagram above, which of the following was likely true about the US population in 2014? A. The total fertility rate was between 1 and 2. B. The total fertility rate was between 2 and 3. C. The total fertility rate was between 3 and 4. D. The total fertility rate was between 4 and 5.", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: The total fertility rate is the number of children an average woman in a given population will bear during her lifetime. Since the shape of the age-structure pyramid for the U.S. shows close to zero growth, the TFR should be close to replacement levels. That means the number should be greater than 2, since the replacement rate would be exactly 2 if factors such as infant mortality didn't have to be accounted for. Eliminate (A). In a developing population, the replacement birth rate may be above 3 because of higher infant mortality rates; however, both common sense and the shape of the pyramid tell you that the U.S. was not in the transitional stage, so eliminate (C) and (D). Its replacement rate should lie between 2 and 3, so (B) is correct."}
{"input": "Catalytic converters on automobiles use chemical reactions to convert pollutants from exhaust into less harmful substances. In order for a catalytic converter to function optimally when regular gasoline is used, a ratio of 14.7 air to 1 fuel is needed. However, certain kinds of fuel require different ratios. For example, E85, an ethanol fuel blend, requires 34% more fuel to balance the reaction. What is the approximate optimal ratio of air to E85 fuel? A. 0.09 to 1 B. 1.34 to 1 C. 10.97 to 1 D. 14.7 to 1", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The calculation required is: since E85 requires 34% more fuel than regular gasoline, for which the catalytic converter needs a ratio of 14.7 air to 1 fuel, the new ratio is 14.7 air to 134% of 1 fuel, or 14.7 air to 1.34 fuel. You can simplify that ratio to 10.97 to 1 using your calculator, but it isn't strictly necessary: you could also estimate that 14.7 ÷ 1.34 will be less than 14.7, but not by too much (14.7 ÷ 2 is around 7.4, so you need a ratio greater than 7.4 to 1). The only choice that's in the correct range is (C), so it has to be correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following is NOT an aspect of the phosphorous cycle? A. Precipitation returning atmospheric phosphorous to land and water B. Geological uplift pushing phosphorous-containing rock to the ocean surface C. Phosphorous from the soil and farming reaching the ocean via leaching and runoff D. Decomposers breaking down phosphorous-containing plant and animal matter into soil", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The phosphorous cycle is the only biogeochemical cycle that does not largely involve the atmosphere, since phosphorus does not exist in the atmosphere outside of dust particles. Therefore, no significant amount of phosphorous exists in precipitation, whereas uplift, decomposition, and leaching/runoff are all significant factors in the phosphorous cycle: (A) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following can be found in the tropopause? A. The jet streams B. The ozone layer C. Aurora borealis and australis D. The gases responsible for the greenhouse effect", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The tropopause is the buffer between the troposphere and the stratosphere. The gases responsible for the greenhouse effect are found in the troposphere, so eliminate (D). The ozone layer is found in the stratosphere, so eliminate (B). And the auroras are found in the thermosphere, so eliminate (C). The jet streams, powerful air currents that drive weather patterns across the globe, are found in the tropopause, so (A) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following is the most common gas in the troposphere? A. Oxygen B. Nitrogen C. Water vapor D. Carbon dioxide", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: The troposphere contains the air we breathe. The vast majority (78%) of it is nitrogen, so (B) is correct. About 21% of it is oxygen, and the remaining 1% includes all the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor."}
{"input": "A. Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, and South Africa B. United States, Australia, and the UK C. China, Egypt, and Thailand D. Brazil, Malaysia, and Japan", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: First, look at the graph to determine where world average biocapacity per person is represented. It's the label on the red line running vertically across the whole graph; the value shown is a little less than 2 global hectares per person. Next, since each answer choice lists three countries, find the one for which the bars representing total ecological footprint forall threefall under that value. Look at the bottom of the graph: the only countries whose total ecological footprint falls under the world average biocapacity value for 2003 are Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Egypt, Thailand, and China. The only answer choice that chooses exclusively from this group is (C), so that choice is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following is a potential benefit of strip cropping? A. Minimizing runoff B. Providing shelter from wind erosion C. Lessening the damage of overgrazing D. Reducing the erosion caused by tillage", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Strip cropping is a sustainable farming technique meant to reduce soil erosion by slowing water flow, or runoff. Choice (A) is correct. The other choices are benefits of other sustainable farming techniques, such as windbreaks (B), no-till farming (D), and rotational grazing (C)."}
{"input": "A small farmer has purchased a new plot of land that she intends to cultivate using sustainable practices. The major issues she wishes to address on the plot include excessive wind erosion, low soil fertility after long-term monoculture, and soil loss due to runoff. Would using strip cropping help her address these issues? A. Yes, because strip cropping protects against wind erosion. B. No, because strip cropping is mainly used to slow soil erosion. C. No, because strip cropping will damage the soil fertility further. D. Yes, because strip cropping will slow runoff and improve soil fertility.", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Strip cropping reduces soil erosion by slowing water flow, or runoff. The passage also states that it involves crop rotation, and that that helps improve soil fertility. Both of these are issues the farmer wants to address, so eliminate (B) and (C). Choice (A) addresses the wrong issue, so eliminate it as well. Choice (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following sustainable agricultural practices has benefits similar to those of strip cropping? A. Terracing B. Windbreaks C. No-till farming D. Rotational grazing", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Strip cropping's benefits are: reduction in soil erosion by slowing water flow, or runoff; and improvement in soil fertility, due to crop rotation. Choice (A), terracing, shares the benefit of reducing runoff, so keep it for now. Choice (B), windbreaks, are mainly used to prevent wind erosion, so eliminate it. No-till farming (C) is used to prevent the erosion that results from tillage (and, to some degree, to improve the impact of irrigation), so eliminate it as well. Rotational grazing (D) is a method of pasturing involving moving grazing animals to different paddocks and allowing the ones not in use to rest and recover. While it may impart some benefit to the soil in terms of reducing water erosion, its main benefits are to herd health and reduced input in terms of feeding the animals, so (A) is a better choice. Choice (A) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following best explains the outcome in the scenario below? A. The specialist species have a disadvantage because there are several of them, and thus they recovered more slowly. B. The specialist species have an advantage in changing conditions that allowed them to recover more quickly. C. The generalist species has an advantage in changing conditions that allowed it to recover more quickly. D. The generalist species has the advantage of being invasive, which allowed it to recover more quickly.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: In the scenario, the generalist species recovers more quickly and ends up with a greater share of the resources compared to several specialist species, meaning it must have had an advantage. Since (B) gives the specialists the advantage, eliminate it first. The question asks for an explanation of the outcome—in other words,whydid the generalist species have the advantage? There is no information given about which species are native and which are invasive, so eliminate (D). There is no reason why there being several specialists to only one generalist would necessarily give the generalist the advantage, so eliminate (A). The key factor here is the wildfire: it caused achangein conditions, and that's what gave the generalist species the advantage in recovery. Choice (C) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following is NOT a reason why the Earth's Northern Hemisphere is hotter during its summer months? A. More direct light from the sun means the light has to pass through less atmosphere before it reaches the Earth's surface. B. More direct light from the sun means a given amount of light is concentrated into a smaller area. C. Shorter distance from the sun means less heat lost before it reaches the Earth. D. Longer daylight hours mean more sunlight for a given area per day.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The underlying reason for the temperature difference between the Earth's seasons is the axial tilt of the planet. This tilt means that the sunlight hits one hemisphere more directly than the other for each half of each year. This increases summer temperatures in two ways: by allowing light to pass through less of the atmosphere before it hits the surface, meaning less heat is absorbed along the way (A); and by concentrating the sunlight into a smaller area because of the angle at which it's hitting the planet (B). It also means that during the spring and summer in either hemisphere, days are longer than nights (while nights are longer than days during autumn and winter). This means more time during which the sun's rays are warming the Earth (D). However, it's not true that the Earth is closer to the sun during the northern summer. In fact, the Earth's perihelion (the moment during its orbit when it's closest to the sun) takes place in early January each year, during the northern winter. Choice (C) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following best describes the type of symbiotic relationship labeled \"Type I\" in the table below? A. Commensalism B. Mutualism C. Parasitism D. Predation", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: The three types of relationship in the table are all described as symbiotic. Since predation is not a type of symbiosis, eliminate (D). The type of symbiosis in which both species receive benefit is mutualism, so (B) is correct."}
{"input": "The diagram below shows the projected recovery of stratospheric ozone levels over the course of the current century according to several models. A. Stage 0: Rapid ozone decrease B. Stage 1: Initial slowing of ozone decline C. Stage 2: Onset of ozone increases D. Stage 3: Full recovery of ozone from ozone-depleting gases", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The current year is closest to the zone markedStage 2: Onset of ozone increasesin the diagram. This is consistent with the fact that depletion of ozone has already slowed considerably since the passing of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1987. Choice (C) is correct."}
{"input": "A number of sheep are introduced to an island with plenty of grazing available, and the population increases rapidly. When the sheep population reaches its carrying capacity, which of the following is likely to occur? A. The population growth will continue to accelerate. B. The population growth will slow until it becomes constant. C. The population growth will stop as sheep choose not to reproduce until more resources are available. D. The population growth will overshoot the carrying capacity and some dieoff will occur until the resources available are adequate to sustain the population.", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: When the sheep population reaches its carrying capacity, its population growth will be checked in some way, so eliminate (A) and (B). The sheep are unlikely to see the problem and make conscious decisions to control their population, so eliminate (C). Rather, overshoot and dieback are likely until an equilibrium is reached: (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following is a source of atmospheric CO2 for which humans are almost entirely responsible? A. Volcanism B. Respiration C. Combustion D. Decomposition", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Respiration and decomposition are biological processes that involve a wide variety of living things, including, but not limited to, humans. Volcanism is a geological process in which humans aren't generally implicated. However, combustion, or burning, is usually a process started by humans, so (C) is correct. All of these processes release CO2into the atmosphere."}
{"input": "One major effect of global climate change is a rise in sea levels. This can cause several negative effects; which of the following is a possible positive effect of this change? A. Loss of estuary and shoreline habitats due to flooding B. Newly created marine habitats on flooded continental shelves C. Change in photic level, causing a lack of sunlight in ocean layers that were previously sunlit D. Loss of the protection from storm surge, tidal waves, and tsunamis afforded by mangroves and tidal marshes", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Choices (A), (C), and (D) all represent actual, but negative, effects of rising sea levels. Only (B) can be seen as a positive effect, so that choice is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following explains why biomagnification is a bigger problem in ocean life than in land animals? A. Marine food chains are longer. B. Marine ecosystems are more complex. C. Land animals encounter fewer pollutants. D. Land animals are less likely to ingest pollutants they encounter.", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Biomagnification is especially problematic in marine ecosystems because the food chains there are longer, so (A) is correct. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are all hard to verify and likely to be untrue in any general sense and thus can't explain this broad difference."}
{"input": "The west Texas region known as the Permian Basin is rich in oil, natural gas, and potash reserves. Which of the following could explain why this region has such a wealth of petroleum resources compared to surrounding areas? A. The basin is in a geographic region of long-term subsidence, the pressure of which has been brought to bear on large deposits of ancient sediment. B. The basin is too far south to be subject to glaciation, which means that surface layers of rock have not been scraped away. C. The basin is in a region of high tectonic activity, the pressure of which accounts for a large amount of metamorphic rock. D. The basin was once the seabed of an ancient ocean, but geologic processes have lifted it up above sea level.", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The question asks for a choice that couldexplainthe wealth of petroleum resources found in the Permian Basin. You don't need to know the specifics of the geologic history of west Texas in order to answer this question. Look instead for an answer that could explain the formation of fossil fuel deposits. Remember, fossil fuels are formed from organic matter that is subject to the pressures of geologic forces. Choice (B) explains why glaciers haven't ripped away surface layers, but says nothing about organic deposits, so eliminate it. Choice (C) gives a reason why metamorphic rock, not organic matter or fossil fuels, would be found in the area: eliminate it as well. Choice (D) is closer, because the seabed of an ancient ocean is likely to have large deposits of organic matter. However, it doesn't explain any geologic forces that could have formed that matter into petroleum. Choice (A) contains the elements you need: deposits of ancient sediment (which would include organic matter), and a geologic process (subsidence) that would put the matter under pressure and could form fossil fuels. Choice (A) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following is an advantage of concentrated animal feeding operations over free-range grazing? A. More animals can be raised for meat in a smaller space, which is more cost-effective for producers and therefore less costly to consumers. B. Less crowding means animals are less susceptible to disease and there is less need for antibiotics to treat livestock. C. Organic waste from the animals can be used as fertilizer and tends to be free of contaminants. D. Animals are fed grains or feed, which are not as suitable as grass and can contribute to disease.", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The question asks for an advantage of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs, or feedlots) over free-range grazing. Eliminate answer choices that are disadvantages of CAFOs—(D)—or advantages of free-range grazing—(B) and (C). Choice (A), cost-effectiveness, is the main advantage CAFOs have over more environmentally friendly methods of meat production."}
{"input": "Which of the following explains how soil protects water quality? A. Soils are formed when rock is weathered, transported, and deposited by wind and water. B. Soil with greater water holding capacity is more productive and fertile. C. Water can erode soil, removing fertile layers and exposing bare rock. D. Soils effectively filter and clean water that moves through them.", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Each choice describes some aspect of the relationship between soils (part of the rock cycle) and water (the water cycle). The only choice that shows how soil protects water quality, however, is (D): by filtering and cleaning water, soils remove adulterants and pollutants and improve the quality of the water passing through them. The other three choices explain ways in which water affects soil. Choice (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following approximates the amount of energy lost through two trophic levels? A. 1% B. 10% C. 90% D. 99%", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Think of the amount of energy invested as 100 units. (What the units are does not matter to the calculation.) Through one trophic level, the 10% rule tells you that 10% of the energy will be conserved (and 90% lost). That means that 10% of 100 units, or 10 units, remain. Through the second trophic level, 10% of this amount will be conserved: 10% of 10 units, or 1 unit, remains. In total, 99 units were lost, which is 99% of the original number. Choice (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Because of impervious surfaces such as roads, sidewalks, parking areas, and rooftops, an acre of city land generates about 5 times as much runoff as an acre of forest. Which of the following represents a method to help reduce urban runoff? A. Solar panels B. Carbon offsets C. Contour plowing D. Permeable pavement", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The answer choices are all possible solutions to environmental problems, so look for the one that specifically addresses urban runoff. Choice (A), contour plowing, addresses agricultural runoff instead, so eliminate it. Choices (B) and (C) are further from the mark: solar panels are a form of clean energy and carbon offsets are meant to address the carbon footprints of individuals or corporations. Choice (D), permeable pavement, would allow the absorption of precipitation into the ground underneath city structures and thus decrease runoff, so it is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following characteristics is most likely to protect a given species against becoming endangered or extinct? A. Mobility B. Limited diet C. High number of competitors D. Specific habitat requirements", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Limited diet, high numbers of competitors, and specific habitat requirements are all factors that can make a speciesmoresusceptible to becoming endangered or extinct in the face of habitat destruction, fragmentation, and/or loss, so eliminate (B), (C), and (D). Mobility, on the other hand, can help a species adapt to these problems by allowing it to seek out new habitats, so (A) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following correctly describes the shift in pH involved in global ocean acidification? A. A change from slightly acidic to slightly basic B. A change from slightly basic to slightly acidic C. A change from slightly basic toward pH-neutral D. A change from pH-neutral toward slightly acidic", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Seawater is slightly basic, so eliminate (A) and (D)—especially (A), since it does not representacidification, but rather a change toward less acidic conditions. In the last couple of centuries, surface ocean pH has decreased from approximately 8.25 to 8.14. This means that the change is not from basic to acidic—eliminate (B)—but rather just from slightly basic to less basic, which matches with the wording \"toward pH-neutral.\" Choice (C) is correct."}
{"input": "The drawings below show how temperature inversion works in cities surrounded by mountains. A. Regulations affecting the pollutants she's interested in B. Output levels for the pollutants she's interested in C. Seasonal temperature variations D. Number of cars in the city", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: The environmental scientist wants to measure the effects of the temperature inversion on levels of pollutants, so other things that might affect levels of pollutants are what she would most likely need to control for. Seasonal temperature variations do not matter to theyearly averagelevels, so eliminate (C). While the number of cars and regulations that affect the pollutants do matter, they do not matter as directly as the actual levels of pollution entering the air, so (B) is better either than (A) or (D). Choice (B) is correct."}
{"input": "Each of the following is a drawback of aquaculture EXCEPT A. Contamination of wastewater B. Density can increase the incidence of disease C. Fish that escape may compete or breed with wild fish D. Small requirements in terms of growing space and fuel", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Choices (A), (B), and (C) all state disadvantages associated with aquaculture (fish farming). Choice (D), however, states an advantage, and is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following does NOT constitute a natural disruption to an ecosystem? A. Seasonal flooding due to monsoons, high tides, or snowmelts B. Periodic sea level changes due to increased glaciation during ice ages C. Local climate change resulting from atmospheric interference of volcanic ash D. Forest fires used as part of forest management strategies leading to ecological succession", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: A natural disruption to an ecosystem is the result of natural, not human-caused, processes. Flooding because of seasonal weather events like monsoons, tides, and snowmelts fits this criterion, as do the effects of a volcanic eruption; similarly, ice age events cause natural changes to sea level. Only forest management is a human activity; as such, it does not constitute a natural disruption, so (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following species has a survivorship curve most similar to the one labeled A in the model below? A. Moose B. Squirrel C. Sparrow D. Tree frog", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The curve labeled A in the model is a Type I survivorship curve, which shows high survivorship among young individuals and greater mortality at advanced age. Large mammals tend to have Type I survivorship, so (A) is correct. Squirrels and sparrows have Type II survivorship (matching line B in the graph), while tree frogs have Type III (matching C)."}
{"input": "Which of the following describes Population b in the graph below? A. Its population growth continues accelerating because the resources it needs are unlimited. B. Its population growth overshoots its carrying capacity; its environment is extremely damaged and the population dies out. C. Its population growth overshoots its carrying capacity; its environment is damaged and the carrying capacity is permanently lowered. D. Its population growth overshoots its carrying capacity; its environment is only lightly damaged and the resources recover, along with the population.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The graph shows what happens to three populations over time. All three populations start out increasing rapidly. Populationsaandbovershoot their carrying capacity more severely; while populationadies out completely,beventually recovers. Populationcalso overshoots, but less drastically, and it recovers as well. The difference betweenbandcon the graph is what happens after their recovery: whilecfluctuates around the population's original carrying capacity,bdoes the same around a new, reduced carrying capacity. The explanation is likely that enough resources were damaged that the environment can now only sustain the population at a lower level. This makes (C) correct."}
{"input": "Geothermal energy is used for heating and electricity generation. Which of the following uses of geothermal energy can function without any infrastructure being built? A. Geothermal district heating B. Geothermal hot spring baths C. Enhanced geothermal systems D. Binary cycle geothermal power plants", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: District heating (A) requires at least the infrastructure to deliver heating to separate homes, while enhanced geothermal systems (C) and binary cycle plants (D) are types of plants (infrastructure) that use geothermal energy to generate electricity. While baths certainly can involve construction, natural hot springs have been used as baths without any modification since ancient times. Choice (B) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following energy sources produces variable renewable energy? A. Biomass B. Wind power C. Geothermal energy D. Dammed hydroelectricity", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Variable renewable energy is a renewable energy source that is non-dispatchable (cannot be used on demand) because of its fluctuating nature, such as wind power—(B) is correct. Dammed hydroelectricity and biomass are controllable renewable energy sources, and geothermal energy is also a relatively constant source."}
{"input": "Which fossil fuel burns the cleanest in terms of CO2 and particulate emissions? A. Coal B. Crude oil C. Petroleum D. Natural gas", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Natural gas has lower CO2and particulate emissions than all other fossil fuel types. Choice (D) is correct."}
{"input": "An area of protected wetland is under environmental threat because runoff from nearby agriculture is polluting water faster than the wetland ecology can purify it, and some activists in the area are calling for a ban on pesticides and fertilizers in soil that drains into the area. Which of the following is a potential disadvantage to this plan? A. Wetland animal populations may suffer health effects from the pollutants. B. An increase in the health of the wetland ecosystem may provide niches for more species to succeed. C. Floods may increase if the wetland area, which likely provides a buffer zone against them, decreases. D. Other types of development may move in, bringing new sources of pollution, if farms' financial stability is harmed.", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The question asks for a potentialdisadvantageto the plan (banning pesticides and fertilizers). Choice (A) is a disadvantage of the pesticides themselves, while (C) is a disadvantage of a potential decrease in the area of the wetlands. Choice (B), on the other hand, is anadvantageof helping the wetlands ecosystem. Only (D) posits a potential disadvantage to the plan: if the ban causes financial harm to the farms in question, then it's possible they will close and other development will move in, posing a whole new threat to the wetland area."}
{"input": "The diagram below shows how a hydrogen fuel cell functions. A. Water is used as an input. B. Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is released. C. Energy is still needed to create the hydrogen gas used as input. D. Energy production from hydrogen fuel cells is highly inefficient.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The diagram shows that oxygen and hydrogen gases are inputs, and the only outputs are heat, water, and electricity. You can eliminate (A) because water is an output, not an input, and (B) because no carbon dioxide is produced. Choice (D) is also incorrect: hydrogen fuel cells are relatively efficient. However, energy must still be used to make hydrogen gas: (C) is correct."}
{"input": "The graph below shows the invasive species in Australia that have the greatest impact against native species there. Which of the following helps explain why the European rabbit has such an advantage in competing against native species? A. Rabbits are an r-selected, specialist mammal species; they reproduce rapidly and fit into a particular niche that tends to be rich in resources. B. Rabbits are an r-selected, generalist mammal species; they reproduce rapidly and use available resources at a faster rate than the varied native species with whom they compete. C. Rabbits are a K-selected, specialist mammal species; the greater investment of parents into offspring allows them to survive at a greater rate than the native species with whom they share a niche. D. Rabbits are a K-selected, generalist mammal species; the greater investment of parents into offspring allows them to survive at a greater rate than the varied native species with whom they compete.", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Rabbits reproduce quickly, put little investment into their young, and have small body size, so they fit the profile ofr-selected species rather well, for mammals. Eliminate (C) and (D). The graph shows that they outcompete thelargest numberof native species; in order to compete with so many other species, they must be generalists. Eliminate (A). Choice (B) explains why rabbits, asr-selected generalists, succeed against so many native species, and is therefore correct."}
{"input": "According to the graph, what is the approximate LD50 of the substance on this population? A. 5 mg/kg B. 80 mg/kg C. 100 mg/kg D. 120 mg/kg", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The LD50of a substance is the dosage it takes to kill 50% of the test population. On the graph, use a piece of paper or a pencil to find a straight horizontal line from the 50% mark on they-axis to the curve. From that point on the curve, find a straight vertical line down to thex-axis, and note the place of intersection. It should intersect at just about 100 mg/kg, so that's the approximate LD50. The correct choice is (C)."}
{"input": "Would the unknown substance in this experiment be considered a poison to the mouse population? A. No, because the mice may be able to detoxify the substance. B. No, because the LD50 of this substance is not 50 mg or less per kg of body weight. C. Yes, because the LD50 of this substance is 100 mg per kg of body weight. D. Yes, because the threshold dose of this substance is below 50 mg per kg of body weight.", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Apoisonis any substance with an LD50of 50 mg or less per kg of body weight, so this substance is not a poison. Eliminate (C) and (D). Since (B) correctly explains why, it is the best choice."}
{"input": "In a second phase of the experiment, the researchers introduced a second, known substance along with the unknown substance, and then measured the effect of the two substances combined on the mouse population. Assuming that the new substance served to decrease toxicity, what can be said about the LD50 of the two-substance combination? A. It is less than 100 mg/kg. B. It is more than 100 mg/kg. C. It is now high enough that the substance will be considered a poison. D. It is low enough that the two-substance combination is considered non-toxic.", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Sincetoxicityjust means the degree to which something is biologically harmful, if the toxicity is reduced, then the new combination should have a higher LD50than the original unknown substance. The only choice you can prove with that information is (B). Both (A) and (C) are false. What constitutes \"non-toxic\" is a matter of some controversy and certainly not something you can prove with only this information. Choice (B) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following is a natural factor that contributes to stratospheric ozone depletion? A. The El Ni?o–Southern Oscillation B. Upwelling of cold water in the Arctic and Antarctic zones C. An increase in the amount of UV rays that reach the Earth's surface D. Melting of ice crystals in the atmosphere at the beginning of the Antarctic spring", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Since neither the El Niño–Southern Oscillation nor the upwelling of cold water in the Arctic and Antarctic zones has any effect on stratospheric ozone, eliminate (A) and (B). An increase in the amount of UV rays that reach the Earth's surface, on the other hand, is aneffectof stratospheric ozone depletion rather than a cause, so eliminate (C) as well. The melting of ice crystals in the atmosphere at the beginning of the Antarctic spring does provide a surface for the conversion of unreactive chlorine compounds into reactive ones: since this is a phenomenon driven by temperature and the Antarctic climate, not by humans, it is a natural factor. Choice (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following explains why a population bottleneck may weaken the likelihood of a species' long-term survival? A. Bottleneck events reduce species richness in a given area. B. Fewer individuals left after a bottleneck event means that the population will never reach its former numbers. C. Bottleneck events reduce genetic diversity, which makes a species less likely to recover from further disruptions. D. Reduced genetic diversity after a bottleneck event means that the population will experience more genetic drift.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: A bottleneck event is one in which the total number of individuals in a population is drastically reduced. This results in less species richness, but that is not relevant to the likelihood of survival for a single species, so eliminate (A). It also results in reduced genetic diversity. While that may increase genetic drift, there is no way to know whether increased genetic drift will help or hurt a given population, so eliminate (D). Additionally, remember that a decreased number of individuals never limits that population's eventual growth; limitations on population growth are imposed by availability of resources. Eliminate (B). Reduced genetic diversity does, however, leave a population more susceptible to the negative effects of further disruptions. Choice (C) is correct."}
{"input": "According to the soil texture triangle below, which type of soil is made up of 40% sand, 35% clay, and 25% silt? A. Clay B. Clay loam C. Sandy loam D. Silty clay loam", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: To read a soil texture triangle, use the line indicated on each axis for a given percentage and find where the three lines intersect. The diagram indicates that you should use the left set of lines for the sand axis, the upper set for the clay axis, and the lower set for the silt axis. Following these for 40%, 35%, and 25%, respectively, you should find the intersection lies in the clay loam region. Choice (B) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following describes the range of conditions (such as salinity, temperature, sunlight, etc.) in which an organism can live, and outside of which death or injury might occur? A. Ecological succession B. Ecological tolerance C. Species distribution D. Biodiversity", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Ecological successionmeans the establishment of a biological community in an area virtually barren of life, and the transitions in species composition of that biological community afterwards.Species distributionrefers to the manner in which the individuals of a species are spatially arranged. The termbiodiversitydescribes the number and variety of organisms found within a specified geographic region, or ecosystem, as well as the variability among living organisms, including the variability within and between species and within and between ecosystems.Ecological tolerancerefers to the range of conditions in which an organism or species can live, so (B) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following gives the correct order of events leading to the rainshadow effect shown below? A. Warm, moisture-laden air from over a body of water moves toward the mountain—as the air rises it cools and water vapor condenses—precipitation removes water vapor from the air—dry air remains on the other side of the mountain, creating a desert climate B. Cool, moisture-laden air from over a body of water moves toward the mountain—as the air rises it warms and water vapor condenses—precipitation removes water vapor from the air—dry air remains on the other side of the mountain, creating a desert climate C. Warm, moisture-laden air from over a body of water moves toward the mountain—as the air rises it cools and water vapor condenses, but since it does not fall a desert climate is produced—precipitation falls on the other side of the mountain D. Cool, moisture-laden air from over a body of water moves toward the mountain—as the air rises it warms and water vapor condenses, but since it does not fall a desert climate is produced—precipitation falls on the other side of the mountain", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The rainshadow effect occurs where high-elevation areas lie near the coasts of warm bodies of water. When the prevailing winds push water-laden air toward land, the air must rise because of the terrain, which cools the air, causing water to condense and fall as precipitation. Thus, the windward side of the mountain or elevated area receives more precipitation and has a lush climate. When the air moves over the peak of elevation, it has been emptied of most of its water vapor, and the air moving down the other side is dry. That side receives less precipitation and has a desert climate. Choice (A) is correct."}
{"input": "According to the graph, which of the following characterizes islands with the greatest species richness? A. Large islands close to the mainland B. Small islands close to the mainland C. Large islands far from the mainland D. Small islands far from the mainland", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Species richness refers to the number of different species represented in an ecological community. The islands with the greatest species richness are those with the most species; those for which the equilibrium point falls farthest to the right on the graph. It shows that large islands close to the mainland have an equilibrium point farthest to the right, so (A) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following could explain why invasive species tend to outcompete native ones when introduced to islands or isolated areas? A. Since limited resources on islands push local species to evolve to be generalists, more specialist mainland species have a short-term advantage in competition. B. Since limited resources on islands push local species to evolve to be specialists, more generalist mainland species have a short-term advantage in competition. C. Both island and mainland species tend to evolve to be specialists, but the greater distance traveled by mainland species leads island species to outcompete them. D. Both island and mainland species tend to evolve to be generalists, but the greater number of mainland species outcompetes the fewer island species.", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: The limited resources on islands and in other isolated areas mean that competition for those resources is high. It benefits individuals to exploit niches, and thus specialization increases in these communities: eliminate (A) and (D). The species found on mainlands include some specialists, but the proportion of generalists is higher, and these generalists have a short-term advantage over specialists when they are introduced as invasive species, in that they can use different resources to thrive as long as those are available. Neither the number of species nor the distance traveled is relevant to the competition for resources the species face. Therefore, (B) is the best choice."}
{"input": "One major source of noise pollution in urban environments is yard maintenance tools, especially the leaf blower. All of the following are more environmentally friendly alternatives to the use of this device EXCEPT A. Using lawn care services rather than individual homeowners being responsible B. Leaving leaves and other debris in place as mulch C. Using lawn space for gardens rather than grass D. Using a rake", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Leaving leaves in place, replacing lawns altogether with gardens, and using a simple rake are all good ways to avoid the use of leaf blowers. However, a lawn care service is just as likely to use these noisy tools as an individual homeowner is, so (A) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following is associated with the cooler \"La Ni?a\" portion of the El Ni?o–Southern Oscillation? A. Air pressure high in the western Pacific and low in the eastern Pacific B. Air pressure high in the eastern Pacific and low in the western Pacific C. Air pressure high in the northern Pacific and low in the southern Pacific D. Air pressure high in the southern Pacific and low in the northern Pacific", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: The El Niño–Southern Oscillation has a warmer phase—el Niño—and a cooler phase—la Niña. During the cooler phase, air pressure is high in the eastern Pacific and low in the western Pacific. During the opposite, warmer phase, air pressure is high in the western Pacific and low in the eastern Pacific, so (A) is describing the el Niño phase. Choice (B) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following is an assumption made in the passage below? A. BPA causes cancers after exposure during any stage of life. B. BPA's effects on animals are not similar to its effects on humans. C. Most obesity is caused by either BPA exposure or lifestyle factors. D. BPA has not recently been banned from use in household products and on receipt paper.", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The passage gives evidence that BPA is correlated with a host of health problems and details everyday objects in which it can be found. It concludes that this endocrine disruptor should be banned. The necessary assumptions to a conclusion about what action should be taken are things like:this course of action will help the problemandthere is no reason it won't help or would make things worse.Evaluate whether the choices given need to be true for the conclusion to make sense. The passage states that BPA is correlated with a higher incidence of cancer and that early developmental stages seem to be the most crucial: BPA doesn't need to be shown to definitively cause cancer, or at all life stages, for banning it to be a helpful move. Eliminate (A). Choice (B) actually hurts the author's cause: if BPA's effects on humans are different from the animal effects cited, there is much less information to go on in terms of whether it should be banned or not. Eliminate (B). Similarly to (A), (C) contains information that is not necessary to the author's argument. There may be many more causes for obesity: as long as BPA is likely to be one of them, it makes sense to ban it. Choice (D), however, needs to be true for the author's point to make sense: if BPA has already been banned, then there's no need to do it anymore. Choice (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following greenhouse gases has the LEAST impact on global climate change? A. CO2 B. CFCs C. Methane D. Water vapor", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: CO2has a GWP (global warming potential) of 1 because other greenhouse gases' GWPs are defined using that gas as a reference point; CFCs and methane have higher GWPs than CO2. However, while water vapor does contribute to global climate change, it doesn't have nearly the effect of these other gases. The hydrologic cycle keeps the amount of water vapor present in the atmosphere in balance. The small effect it has is due to the warming caused by other gases: once the atmosphere warms, it can hold more water vapor, and that does intensify the greenhouse effect some via positive feedback. Since its effect is less and does not occur independent of other causes, (D), water vapor, is the correct choice."}
{"input": "The acronym HIPPCO describes the main factors leading to a decrease in biodiversity. Which of the following gives four of these factors? A. Habitat destruction, invasive species, population movements, and coastal displacement B. Habitat destruction, increase in greenhouse gases, pollution, and ocean acidification C. Invasive species, polar warming, climate change, and ozone depletion D. Invasive species, population growth, pollution, and climate change", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The acronym HIPPCO stands for habitat destruction, invasive species, population growth, pollution, climate change, and over-exploitation.

{"input": "A. Countries with higher population use more energy. B. Countries with lower population tend to use more energy per person. C. Countries with lower agricultural populations are more industrialized and have higher energy demands. D. Countries with higher agricultural populations are more mechanized and have higher energy demands.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The graph shows that countries with lower agricultural populations have higher energy use per person. This fits with the trend that more industrialized countries have higher energy demands, since more industrialization corresponds with less agricultural population. Choice (C) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following gives both an advantage and a disadvantage of the mechanization of farming practices that took place during the Green Revolution? A. Mechanization increased profits but required reliance on genetically modified organisms. B. Mechanization greatly increased efficiency on farms and also increased reliance on fossil fuels. C. Mechanization increased the use of pesticides and the overuse of water resources for irrigation. D. Mechanization made it easier to grow whole fields of the same crop, leaving farmers susceptible to disaster if pests or disease affected a specific crop too much.", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Choice (B) gives both an advantage (increased efficiency) and a disadvantage (reliance on fossil fuels) of mechanization, so it is the best answer. Choice (A) is untrue: mechanization and genetic modification are separate innovations, and do not specifically require each other. Choice (C) gives two disadvantages (increased pesticide use and overuse of water), and choice (D) really only gives one disadvantage—monoculture—and explains its negative effects."}
{"input": "Which of the following is NOT usually a component of indoor air pollution, according to the information above? A. VOCs B. Hydrocarbons C. Mold and bacteria D. Particulates from smoke", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: The passage states thatpollutants, including gases (such as radon, carbon monoxide, and VOCs), particulates (from sources such as tobacco smoke, indoor fires, and asbestos), and microbial contaminants (such as mold or bacteria)are often responsible for poor indoor air quality. Choices (A), (C), and (D) are mentioned in this list. The correct choice is (B), hydrocarbons, as these usually result from vehicle exhaust and manufacturing, not indoor sources."}
{"input": "A building manager suspects that a certain number of sicknesses in employees in the building are due to Sick Building Syndrome and takes certain measures to reduce the problem. She arranges for an expert diagnosis and repair of the building's HVAC system and also has the carpets and walls professionally cleaned. Which of the following needs to be true for her plan to be successful? A. The indoor air quality in the building is being adversely affected by pollutants. B. The employees all spend a minimum of 8 hours in the building per workday. C. Mold is the factor responsible for a majority of the sickness. D. The carpet is releasing VOCs through off-gassing.", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: In order for the building manager's plan to be successful, the steps she takes (cleaning and repairing) need to make a difference to the health of the employees. If (A) were untrue, then neither cleaning nor repairing would make any difference—it would mean that the sickness was due to some other problem. Choice (A) is necessary to the plan and is correct. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are all possible, but none of them is necessary to the building manager's plan—any one of them could be untrue, but as long as the main problem is stillsomethingto do with air quality, her plan will work."}
{"input": "Which of the following proposed solutions to the problems of indoor air pollution and Sick Building Syndrome would have the most far-reaching effects? A. An initiative providing low-cost cleaning for affected buildings B. A safety requirement for radon detectors to be installed in all office buildings C. A tax leveraged against businesses that do not provide employees suspected to have SBS with paid sick leave D. Building codes addressing multiple sources of indoor air pollution and requiring their prevention in all new construction", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Since the question asks for the proposed solution with the most far-reaching effects, look for an answer that would affect all or nearly all cases of SBS in the future. Radon is only one in a long list of pollutants listed that relate to the syndrome, so eliminate (B). While providing cleaning for affected buildings would certainly help in plenty of cases, it's only one of several solutions, and won't help in cases in which the problem is caused by bad ventilation or problems with HVAC systems, so eliminate (A). A tax against businesses not providing sick leave will help the employees to cope with symptoms, but won't relieve the cause of those symptoms, so eliminate (C). If building codes require the prevention of several sources of indoor air pollution inallnew construction, many future cases of SBS will be prevented entirely. Choice (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Which type(s) of solar energy does the house employ? A. II only B. I and II only C. I and III only D. I, II, and III", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Remember to use Process of Elimination on I/II/III questions. The diagram shows a solar panel, which is another name for a photovoltaic solar cell. Statement III is true, so eliminate (A) and (B). Since I is present in both remaining choices, statement I must be true: the house uses passive solar energy (you can tell it's true because the window is angled and only present on one side of the house—it's meant to capture solar energy through the greenhouse effect, and to capture more energy in winter than in summer). Now address statement II. Active solar energy systems use solar energy to heat a liquid that passes through mechanical and electric equipment to collect and store the energy captured. Since this type of system is not present in the diagram, statement II is false. Eliminate (D); the correct choice is (C)."}
{"input": "The house uses each of the following methods to conserve energy and resources EXCEPT A. Hydroelectric power B. Rainwater collection C. Wind energy D. Solar energy", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The solar panels and passive solar heating you noticed in Question 68 mean that (D) is used, so eliminate it. Look for evidence of the other methods. The labeled wind generator on the roof is evidence of the use of wind energy, so eliminate (C). The cistern (labeled \"collects rainwater\") at the right side of the diagram is evidence of rainwater collection, so eliminate (B). There is no indication of a hydroelectric power system in the house, so (A) is correct."}
{"input": "At the right side of the diagram, to the left of the labeled cistern, is a wall made of rammed earth tires labeled \"thermal mass.\" With which of the following types of energy conservation does this feature help? A. Greywater reuse B. Rainwater collection C. Passive solar heating D. Solar and wind energy collection", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The label \"thermal mass\" is a clue to what the wall of tires is used for. It must have something to do with heat, so you can eliminate (A) and (B). Although it relates to solar energy, it's not connected or related to the wind energy generator, so eliminate (D). Choice (C) is correct: a thermal mass is a mass that will collect and store heat for a time, allowing the passive solar radiation the house collects to last during non-daylight hours."}
{"input": "The diagram below shows the hierarchy of steps involved in Integrated Pest Management, and some examples for each step. A. It can be rigid and might be inadequate for certain environments. B. It can be complex and expensive to implement. C. It can lessen disruptions to the local biome. D. It can minimize threats to human health.", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Integrated Pest Management is a system used to effectively control pests while minimizing disruption to the environment. As the diagram shows, it involves a combination of methods and a hierarchy for when to use what. The complexity of the system compared to methods involving a singular technique should be evident, and complexity often leads to expense: (B) is correct. Rigidity is the opposite problem, so eliminate (A); and (C) and (D) both give advantages, not disadvantages, so eliminate them as well."}
{"input": "The graph below shows a trend in sea surface temperatures at the Great Barrier Reef over a period of 116 years. A. 1942 B. 1966 C. 2008 D. 2016", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The only year shown that has a March temperature more than 1°C above average is 2016, so (D) is correct."}
{"input": "All of the following are ways global climate change can cause widespread habitat destruction EXCEPT A. Rise in sea level B. Increase in pollution C. Temperature changes D. Change in amounts of precipitation", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Since pollution is a separate problem from climate change, (B) is not a way climate change can cause habitat destruction, so it is the correct choice. Rise in sea level, temperature changes, and precipitation changes are all effects of climate change that can indeed cause habitat destruction."}
{"input": "According to the graphs, which of the following characterizes the average movement of the given species between 1999 and 2000? A. Small amount of drift southward and small decrease in depth B. Small amount of drift northward and small decrease in depth C. Significant drift northward and small increase in depth D. Significant drift southward and small increase in depth", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Between the years 1999 and 2000, the first graph shows an average distance of approximately 7 miles northward. Eliminate (A) and (D). The second graph shows an increase in depth of about 3 feet, so eliminate (B) as well. Choice (C) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following could explain the trends shown in the graphs—the species moving both northward and deeper over time? A. Ocean warming has caused the species to move toward areas that were once warmer than the temperature range to which it is adapted. B. Ocean cooling has caused the species to move toward areas that were once warmer than the temperature range to which it is adapted. C. Ocean warming has caused the species to move toward areas that were once cooler than the temperature range to which it is adapted. D. Ocean cooling has caused the species to move toward areas that were once cooler than the temperature range to which it is adapted.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Since this is a marine species, think about what would make it move both northward and deeper. Since water is cooler in the depths than the shallows, the creature probably is in water that is warming, resulting in a movement toward cooler water. In the northern hemisphere, the northward movement would have the same result. Choice (C) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following gives the approximate total net change in distance and depth of this species for the years measured? A. 17 miles north and 44 feet deeper B. 25 miles north and 23 feet deeper C. 25 miles north and 44 feet deeper D. 17 miles north and 23 feet deeper", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Subtract the greatest from the least value on each graph: 25 miles – 0 miles = 25 miles north; 44 feet – 0 feet = 44 feet deeper. The reason both minimum values are zero is that these graphs both show the changefrom initial position, which is represented as 0 change. Choice (C) is correct."}
{"input": "Burning biomass releases CO2. How can some biomass energy generation still be considered carbon-negative? A. Photosynthesis cycles the CO2 back into new crops. B. Some biomass use falls below the allowable threshold for CO2 emissions. C. Some plant and animal material used as biomass grows quickly enough to replace what's used. D. Biomass burning produces air pollution in the form of carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds.", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Carbon neutrality means achieving net zero carbon dioxide emissions, either by eliminating CO2emissions entirely or by balancing emissions with carbon removal; so the term \"carbon-negative\" means that the balance of carbon removal with emissions is on the side of removal. Since you know that burning biomass involves some CO2release, look for an answer that involves some sort of carbon removal. Choice (A) shows how photosynthesis can remove CO2, so it is correct. Choice (B) focuses only on emissions, so it can't explain how you get to a carbon-negative balance; choice (C) focuses on renewability; and choice (D) simply brings up a separate problem."}
{"input": "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a population in the transitional state of the Demographic Transition Model? A. High birth rate B. Lowered death rate C. High infant mortality D. High level of education for women", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: In the Demographic Transition Model, the transitional state (Phase 2) is the phase during which the greatest population increase occurs due to a high birth rate and a lowered death rate—eliminate (A) and (B). Since infant mortality and child labor tend to still be high in this phase, you can also eliminate (C). However, the level of education for women doesn't tend to increase until later stages in the DTM; conversely, higher levels of education for women tend to lower the total fertility rate and push a population toward later stages in the DTM. Choice (D) is correct."}
{"input": "Malaria is a widespread disease, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions, that claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year worldwide. Which of the following is a factor that may cause an increase in malaria cases? A. Climate change B. Drug resistance C. Development of a malaria vaccine D. More widespread use of mosquito netting", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The question asks for a factor causing anincreasein malaria cases. Eliminate (C) and (D): if these have an effect, it will be towarddecreasingnumbers of malaria cases. Choice (B) looks appealing, but keep in mind that drug resistance matters totreatment, and thereforeoutcome, of malaria cases; it should not affect the base number of cases that occur. Climate change, however, is likely to have a negative effect on this worldwide health problem; malaria is a vector disease carried by mosquitos, and as global temperatures increase the range of these insects widens and the potential for infection therefore grows. The correct choice is (A)."}
{"input": "Which of the following is NOT likely to be true about an r-selected species? A. They tend to have small body size. B. Their life expectancy tends to be long. C. They may reproduce only once in their lifespans. D. Competition for resources in their habitat is relatively low.", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Anr-selected species is one that reproduces early in life and has a high capacity for reproductive growth. This normally corresponds with bountiful resources or low competition (D). Usuallyr-selected species produce many offspring each time they reproduce, but they may not reproduce very many times—perhaps even only once (C). They tend to be small (A) and mature quickly, but their lifespans tend to be relatively short. Thus (B) is NOT true and is the correct answer."}
{"input": "Which of the following plate boundaries most likely is characterized by seafloor spreading and rift valleys? A. Nazca–South American boundary B. Australian–Pacific boundary C. Antarctic–Pacific boundary D. Indian-Eurasian boundary", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The map shows whether plates at each boundary are moving apart (divergent) or toward each other (convergent). A boundary characterized by seafloor spreading and rift valleys should be a divergent boundary. Since (A), (B), and (D) are convergent boundaries, only (C) can be correct."}
{"input": "Which type of plate boundary typically results in mountain creation, island arcs, earthquakes, and/or volcanoes? A. Convergent boundary B. Divergent boundary C. Transform boundary D. Triple junction", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Mountain creation is a result of orogenic belts (also called collision boundaries), which are convergent boundaries between two continental plates. Subduction zones, or convergent boundaries between oceanic and continental plates, usually cause volcanoes to form, along with deep trenches. Convergent boundaries between two oceanic plates can form island chains. All of these types can result in earthquakes due to the compression and tension between colliding plates."}
{"input": "For which evolutionary process do ring species provide evidence most directly? A. Speciation B. Natural selection C. Sexual selection D. Extinction", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Speciation is the process by which populations evolve to become distinct species. A ring species is an example of a species that is \"caught in the act\" of speciation: the end populations. If looked at in the absence of the other populations, they would be considered distinct species because of their inability to interbreed. However, the connectedness of the ring shows that the parent population was originally one species."}
{"input": "Which two populations in the diagram above represent the end populations? A. Parental population and A4 B. Parental population and B3 C. A1 and B1 D. A4 and B3", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The passage states that the end populations are those \"that are too distantly related to interbreed.\" Looking at the key, you can see that there is gene flow between each set of neighboring populations except for A4 and B3. There's no evidence in the diagram as to whether the parental population can interbreed with other populations besides those it neighbors."}
{"input": "Based on the chart, which category of invasive species in the Great Lakes showed the greatest increase from the 1950s to the 1960s? A. Invertebrates B. Plants C. Protists D. Bacteria/Viruses", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Looking at the chart, you can see that for most types of organisms there was no significant increase between the bars for the 1950s and the 1960s. However, the protists group just about doubled. Therefore, protists showed the greatest increase between those decades."}
{"input": "Which of the following represents the approximate percentage increase in the total number of invasive species in the Great Lakes between the 1980s and the 2000s? A. 13% B. 20% C. 30% D. 80%", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: To find a percentage change, divide the difference by the original amount, and then multiply by a factor of 100 to get the value into percentage form. The total number of invasive species in the Great Lakes in the 1980s was about 150, while in the 2000s it was about 180. The difference is 180 – 150 = 30. So, divide: 30 ÷ 150 = 0.2. This is equivalent to 20%."}
{"input": "What type of event might result in a bare area where this type of ecological succession could occur? A. Fire B. Tornado C. Clear-cutting D. Glacial retreat", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Primary succession begins in virtually lifeless areas, such as those that result from lava flows or glacial retreat. Secondary succession takes place where an existing community has been cleared by a disturbance event (such as a fire, tornado, or human impact) but the soil has been left intact. Since the description tells you this example is of primary ecological succession (and the model begins with bare rock, not soil), only (D) can be correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following animal species is likely to exist in this area during the second stage (Lichen, Algae, Mosses, Bacteria)? A. mites, ants, spiders B. nematodes, flying insects C. lugs, snails, salamanders, frogs D. squirrels, foxes, mice, moles, birds", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: While ecological succession theory was developed mostly by botanists, the stages include animal species as well as plants. The most likely species to survive in an early stage such as that dominated by lichens, algae, mosses, and bacteria are the smallest: tiny insects that can feed on these primary producers and live in the cracks between them. Therefore, (A) is the best choice."}
{"input": "All of the following could be components of the influence of human activity on soil formation EXCEPT A. Alteration of soil chemistry B. Compaction C. Decomposition D. Salinization", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The effects of human activity must increasingly be acknowledged as a factor in soil development. Human use of fertilizers and pesticides, and pollution and its side effects such as acid rain, can alter soil chemistry. Roads with vehicle traffic and heavy machinery for agriculture and construction can compact soil, and irrigation and depletion of groundwater can cause salinization. Decomposition, on the other hand, is the province of other organisms such as bacteria and fungi that live within the soil, so (C) does NOT represent a human influence."}
{"input": "Which of the following is true about soils used by humans? A. Loamy soils composed of a balanced mixture of clay, silt, and sand are not ideal for plant growth. B. Soil is considered a nonrenewable resource. C. Monoculture practices in modern agriculture tend to enhance soil quality. D. The structure of soil (the extent to which it aggregates or clumps) is unimportant with respect to its arability.", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: The question asks which statement is true: only (B) is correct. Soil is considered nonrenewable because it requires a great length of time to form. Loamy soils are considered ideal for plant growth; monocultural agriculture tends to decrease soil quality by decreasing biodiversity and leaching specific nutrients, and soil needs good structure to be arable."}
{"input": "Which of the following is NOT a possible effect of ocean acidification that may impact human life and industry? A. Coral bleaching B. Disruption of marine food webs C. Release of more CO2 into the atmosphere D. Putting endangered species more at risk due to habitat loss", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Coral bleaching, (A), affects whole ecosystems built around coral reefs, which can impact human fishing (as well as leisure activities such as snorkeling). That's one example of the larger category of problems that (B) represents: any marine ecosystem that is disrupted by acidification can become imbalanced and this affects its food webs, which directly impacts human fishing. Choice (D) affects humans less directly, but habitat loss causing further endangerment to already-threatened species may cause extinctions that could have big repercussions to ecosystems and food chains. However, release of more CO2into the atmosphere is not a potential problematic effect of ocean acidification. CO2emissions cause ocean acidification, not the other way around, and acidification actually removes CO2from the atmosphere ((C) is correct)."}
{"input": "Which is likely to be the best long-term solution to the problem of ocean acidification? A. Reducing CO2emissions B. Reducing overfishing and water pollution C. Reforestation to add more oxygen to the atmosphere D. Feeding iron to phytoplankton to speed up photosynthesis", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The only effective solution currently considered for the problem of ocean acidification is the reduction of CO2emissions on a global scale, (A). This makes sense, since the problem is a direct result of these emissions. Reducing overfishing and water pollution, (B), will certainly help with other problems and help increase resilience of marine organisms to acidification, but doesn't actually address the problem itself. Reforestation, (C), will help with air quality but won't directly impact CO2emissions or ocean acidification. Finally, iron fertilization, (D), has been considered as a possible mitigation approach to counter the effects of acidification, but hasn't been shown to be effective or free from unwanted side effects. If you don't know anything about iron fertilization, you can still tell that (A) is the best choice because you know it directly addresses the problem at hand."}
{"input": "The surface pH of the world's oceans has decreased since preindustrial times by about 0.11 pH units, which indicates an increase of almost 30% in the concentration of H+ ions. If ocean surface pH is expected to drop by a further 0.3 to 0.5 pH units by 2100, approximately what range of possible increase does that represent in terms of H+ ion concentration? A. 82%–136% B. 100%–216% C. 173%–355% D. 400%–600%", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Keep in mind that pH is a logarithmic scale. If a decrease of 0.11 pH units corresponds to an increase of almost 30% in H+ions, that means that log10x –log10y ≈0.11. Remember that logbx –logby =logb, so log10≈ 0.11; in other words, 100.11≈. So≈ 1.28824…. and you can see that that is equivalent to almost a 30% increase. So use the same process to find equivalent percentage increases for the range of pH decreases given: if the pH drops by 0.3 units, then 100.3≈, so≈ 1.9953, which is approximately a 100% increase. And if the pH drops by 0.5 units, then 100.5≈, so≈ 3.1623, which is approximately a 216% increase. Choice (B) is correct."}
{"input": "The goal of the second stage of a wastewater treatment plant is to A. remove the large solid material B. aerate the water C. remove chemicals such as DDT or PCBs D. lower the amount of organic material in the water", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Wastewater treatment plants use a three-step process in removing waste from water. The main goals of sewage treatment are to remove the solid waste and reduce the biological oxygen demand (BOD). This BOD is a measure of how much organic material is in the water and how much bacteria can live in the water. The first stage of wastewater treatment is the mechanical removal of solid objects, and screens of various sizes are used to perform this task. In the second stage, the water is sprayed on a bed of rocks that harbor billions of bacteria. The bacteria break down the organic molecules and lower the BOD. After the remaining liquid is treated, chlorine is put into the water to control bacteria populations."}
{"input": "Which of the following organisms are the first to be adversely affected by thermal pollution in a stream? A. Trees along the bank B. Insect larvae in the water C. Large fish migrating upstream D. Bacteria in the water", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Insect larvae are the organisms most vulnerable to changes in abiotic factors like thermal pollution. As is true with the young of most species, the larval forms constitute the most vulnerable stage of an insect's life cycle. Species whose populations rise and fall with changes in abiotic factors are calledindicator species.The presence of an indicator species in a certain ecosystem tells ecologists that the stream water is ideal to live in—if a fragile indicator species inhabits the region, then it must be safe for all species. If the indicator species is not there, then the water is not optimally clean."}
{"input": "Which of the values below best represents the LD50 in this experiment? A. 4.0 B. 4.5 C. 3.0 D. 2.5", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The LD50is the value at which 50% of a population dies. If you read the graph, you can see that that value falls closest to the solution with the pH of 3.0. LD50values are important because they help us understand the health risks of certain materials. As you might imagine, if a chemical is very toxic, it has a very low LD50. For example, the nerve agent VX has an LD50of 0.14 mg/kg body weight! It is extremely harmful to humans: this LD50value tells you that it only takes 10.2 mg of nerve agent VX to kill half of the test population of 155-pound males! For the test, just remember that the smaller the LD50number, the more toxic a chemical is."}
{"input": "Which of the following, if added to the solutions, would lead to an increase in pH? A. Limestone B. Carbon dioxide C. Nitrogen dioxide D. Sulfur dioxide", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Choices (B), (C), and (D) are all pollutants involved in the production of acid precipitation that would lead to a decrease in the pH, not an increase. Therefore, these choices are incorrect. Limestone, (A), is a base and would increase the pH of the solution. Choice (A) is correct."}
{"input": "Which of the following best describes the goal of the experiment? A. To observe how many fish would hatch at different pH values B. To find out how many fish live in streams with different pH values C. To understand how acid rain affects life in streams D. To see what chemical is best at changing the pH of water", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The purpose of this test is to observe how many fish hatch at different pH values, plain and simple. If you chose any other answer, then you might have been reading too much into the experiment. Remember not to make any inferences—you must answer the question only on the basis of the information you're given. In this experiment, the survival percentage is the dependent variable, and the pH is the independent variable. The data collected relate to hatching survival rates. pH is one of the most important abiotic factors for aquatic organisms. If the pH value shifts out of the ideal range, then the essential proteins in the cells that constitute fish eggs can denature. If that happens, the young will not survive."}
{"input": "The pH value is a measure of the A. amount of heavy metals in the water B. biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the water C. concentration of oxygen in the water D. concentration of hydrogen ions in the water", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Only (D) correctly defines pH. pH is the measure of the number of hydrogen ions in a solution. Chemically speaking, it is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration. So, if a solution has 10–7hydrogen ions in it, then –log 10–7= –(–7) = 7. The pH of the solution is 7; the solution is neutral. The pH scale runs from 0–14; acidic solutions have a pH less than 7, while basic solutions have a pH greater than 7. Logarithms are used to keep the numbers simple because the range of hydrogen ion concentrations can be as high as 100 trillion!"}
{"input": "Which of the following laws created the Superfund program? A. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) B. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act C. Clean Air Act D. National Environmental Policy Act", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) is a law that was passed to establish the \"Superfund.\" This law created a tax on the chemical and petroleum industries and provides broad federal authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or the environment. Choice (B) is incorrect: RCRA established a system for managing non-hazardous and hazardous solid wastes in an environmentally sound manner. Specifically, it provides for the management of hazardous wastes from their point of origin to their point of final disposal (\"cradle to grave\"). RCRA also promotes resource recovery and waste minimization. Choice (C) is responsible for air pollution control. Finally, (D) mandates that environmental impact studies be done before major construction projects are started."}
{"input": "Late fall frosts and the northward migration of some tree and plant species may indicate which of the following global changes? A. Increased global temperatures B. The effects of more ultraviolet light from the sun C. A reduction in the volume of ice at the North and South Poles D. Changes in global precipitation patterns", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Increased global temperatures are responsible for the phenomena in most of the other answer choices! Global warming is more formally referred to as tropospheric warming. You learned that the atmosphere contains much H2O vapor as well as trace amounts of CO2, CH4, and NO2. These gases reflect infrared radiation that is, itself, reflected off the Earth's surface as it is warmed by the sun. This process of tropospheric warming is called the \"greenhouse effect,\" and it is a natural phenomenon. However, as humans burn huge amounts of fossil fuels, the excess CO2and NO2enter the atmosphere. These gases increase the heat-storing capacity of the atmosphere, which causes average global temperatures to increase. This, in turn, can cause late fall frosts and the northward migration of tree and plant species."}
{"input": "High infant mortality rates are likely to exist in countries that have A. a strong and stable economy B. high levels of education for adults C. a stable food supply D. high levels of infectious diseases", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: This is an easy one. All of the answer choices are \"positive\" answer choices—which you would not think would cause high infant mortality—except (D). In fact, (D) is one strong indicator of countries that exhibit high infant mortality. Generally, high infant mortality rates occur in nations where the Gross Domestic Income (GDI) is low (less than $4,000). These nations cannot offer infant support services such as medicine, clean drinking water, sewage removal, and food—and this leads to high rates of infectious disease. Choices (A), (B), and (C) all occur in countries that have low infant mortality rates."}
{"input": "All of the following statements are true EXCEPT A. energy can be converted from one form to another B. energy input always equals energy output C. energy and matter can generally be converted into each other D. at each step of an energy transformation, some energy is lost to heat", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Choice (C) is the only false statement among the answer choices. This question requires that you be familiar with the first two laws of thermodynamics. The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. That is, the total energy of a system will always remain the same. The second law states that at each energy transformation, some energy is lost to the surroundings in an unusable form (usually as heat). For example, as a flashlight runs using battery power, some of the energy from the batteries goes toward warming the light bulb, which is not useful work."}
{"input": "Oxygen-depleted zones of the oceans, such as the one at the mouth of the Mississippi River, are most likely caused by A. a reduction in the plant life in rivers that empty into the ocean near the dead zone B. excessive fertilizers carried into the ocean, which cause algal blooms that lower the oxygen levels C. thermal pollution in the ocean D. acid precipitation falling onto the ocean", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: The area of the Gulf of Mexico that extends from just south of the Mississippi River mouth to Texas receives nutrient-rich water from both the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers. The water from these rivers carries runoff fertilizers from farms that lie in or near the watersheds for the rivers. These nutrients promote a rapid rise in the algae population in the Gulf waters, which in turn causes eutrophication. When the algal cells die, bacteria living in the water decompose them, or break them down. These decomposers use oxygen for metabolism, and eventually the water becomes extremely oxygen poor. Low levels of oxygen often make these bodies of water uninhabitable for other aquatic organisms."}
{"input": "One potential benefit of using genetically modified foods is A. the release of genes to other plants or animals B. the resistance of crops against pesticides C. their growth in monoculture leads to a reduction in biodiversity in the area D. unknown effects on the ecosystem into which they are released", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Choice (B) is a positive effect, while all of the other answer choices cite negative effects of genetically modified foods. Genetically modified foods (GMFs) are crop plants to which genes from other species have been added. For example, the \"Flavr Savr\" tomato, sold from 1994 to 1997, contained select genes from fish! These genes were inserted into the tomato's genes so that the tomatoes would not freeze in a frost. Additional positive aspects for GMFs include increased yields, increased resistance to pests, resistance against pesticides, and the potential to grow in habitats that previously did not support the plants."}
{"input": "Which of the following compounds would probably supply the greatest amount of useful energy to humans? A. The exhaust from a car B. Unrefined aluminum ore C. A glass bottle D. A liter of gasoline", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: \"Energy usefulness\" is defined as how helpful an energy source is to humans. A source is more useful if it costs little to harvest, transport, and use. Useful energy is most commonly in a concentrated form. For example, coal is highly useful compared to wind energy; (A), (B), and (C) are all examples of low-quality energy and matter."}
{"input": "Which of the following choices gives the geologic eras in the correct sequence, from the oldest to the most recent? A. Cenozoic—Mesozoic—Paleozoic—Precambrian B.

{"input": "Approximately what percentage of the world's solid waste does the United States produce? A. 50 percent B. 33 percent C. 10 percent D. 5 percent", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Although the United States holds only 4.6 percent of the world's population, it produces 33 percent of the world's solid waste."}
{"input": "Which of the following correctly describes conservation easement? A. A process that conserves soil from erosion B. A binding agreement that preserves land from further development in exchange for tax write-offs C. An agreement that allows a developer to add new land to a housing project with little input from neighbors D. A practice that prevents the breakdown of stream banks", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: A conservation easement is a voluntary agreement that allows a landowner to limit the type or amount of development on his or her property, while retaining private ownership of the land. The easement is signed by the landowner, who is the easement donor, and the conservancy, who is the party receiving the easement. The conservancy accepts the easement with understanding that it must enforce the terms of the easement in perpetuity. After the easement is signed, it is recorded with the County Register of Deeds and applies to all future owners of the land. In conservation easements, the owner usually receives a tax break for the promise that he or she will not build on that land."}
{"input": "The highest priority of the Clean Water Act is to provide A. guidance in toxic chemical disposal B. funds to reclaim old strip mines C. policies to lessen the number of oil spills in the ocean D. policies to attain fishable and swimmable waters in the United States", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Choice (D) is the defining policy statement of the CWA. This law governs the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the United States. It gives the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to implement pollution control programs and sets wastewater standards for industry. The Clean Water Act also continues to set water quality standards for all contaminants in surface waters. The act makes it unlawful for any person to discharge any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters unless a permit was obtained under its provisions. It also funds the construction of sewage treatment plants under the construction grants program, and recognizes the need to address the critical problems posed by non-point source pollution."}
{"input": "Which of the following best describes changes in the genetic composition of a population over many generations? A. Evolution B. Mutation C. Natural selection D. Biomagnification", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Evolution is the change in the genetic makeup of a population over time. For this exam, the key is to remember that individuals do not evolve and that only populations can evolve. Choice (B) is not a good answer because a mutation is a change in DNA. Choice (C) is also incorrect—evolution can occur in ways other than natural selection. Finally, we can eliminate (D) because it refers to an increase, or magnification, of toxins in a food chain."}
{"input": "Women have fewer and healthier children when all of the following are true EXCEPT A. they have little education B. they live where their rights are not suppressed C. they have access to medicine and health care D. the cost of a child's education is high", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: This question requires you to understand the factors that determine the number of offspring that women are expected to have from a statistical standpoint. Generally speaking, prosperity, high income, and a high level of education are all factors that lower a woman's total fertility rate (the number of offspring she will have). Statistically, the less wealthy and less educated a woman is, the higher her expected total fertility rate will be. Choices (B) through (D) all list factors that lower the total fertility rate, so the correct answer is (A)."}
{"input": "Which of the following is a true statement? A. The population size of organisms following a logical population growth is not limited by a carrying capacity. B. The population size of organisms following an exponential growth is limited by a carrying capacity. C. Increasing the death rate of a population can lower the carrying capacity. D. Increasing the rate of food production can increase the carrying capacity.", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The carrying capacity is the maximum number of organisms that can live sustainably in a habitat. Increasing the rate of food production can increase the carrying capacity, so (D) is the correct answer. Organisms with a carrying capacity have a logistical population growth, so (A) and (B) are incorrect. Choice (C) is also incorrect because carrying capacity is not affected by the death rate."}
{"input": "An increase in the amount of UV light striking the Earth as a result of ozone loss will cause which of the following? A. Global climate change B. Increased skin cancer rates in humans C. Lowering of ocean water levels D. An increase in CO2 in the atmosphere", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: As chlorine atoms (from CFCs) catalyze the breakdown of ozone molecules in the stratosphere, more ultraviolet light is expected to reach the Earth's surface. These UV rays will break down DNA molecules in human skin cells, which can lead to cancers, cataracts, and other illnesses. Of course, other animals and plants can also be affected. While you may have been tempted to choose (A), (B) is a better option because it is more specific—(A) is much too general to be correct. Choice (C) is an opposite and (D) is a result of global warming."}
{"input": "Ozone in the troposphere can result in all of the following EXCEPT A. eye irritation B. lung cancer C. bronchitis D. headache", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Ozone is generated as a secondary pollutant in photochemical smog. Now, this is an EXCEPT/NOT/LEAST question, so remember that you're looking for the incorrect answer! The exposure to tropospheric ozone can cause all of the symptoms given in (A), (C), and (D). However, (B), lung cancer, is primarily caused by smoking cigarettes."}
{"input": "Which of the following describes the amount of energy that plants pass on to herbivores? A. The amount of solar energy in a biome B. The First Law of Thermodynamics C. The Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of an area D. The Second Law of Thermodynamics", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is the rate at which all the plants in an ecosystem produce net useful chemical energy. It is equal to the difference between the rate at which the plants in an ecosystem produce useful chemical energy and the rate at which they use some of that energy through cellular respiration. It is calculated by taking the Gross Primary Productivity (the amount of sugar that the plants produce in photosynthesis) and subtracting from that the amount of energy the plants need for growth, maintenance, repair, and reproduction. NPP is measured in kilocalories per square meter per year (kcal/m2/y). Choice (A) is incorrect because it denotes the amount of energy available for photosynthesis. Choice (B) is no good; it merely states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Choice (D) can also be eliminated; it states that at each energy transfer, some energy is lost to the environment."}
{"input": "The Second Law of Thermodynamics relates to living organisms because it explains why A. matter is never destroyed but it can change shape B. plants need sunlight in order to survive C. all living things must have a constant supply of energy in the form of food D. the amount of energy flowing into an ecosystem is the same as the amount flowing out of that system", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Choice (C) is the only option that relates to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Recall that the second law states that at each step of energy transformation, a large amount of energy is lost as heat to the environment. When we eat food, our bodies convert the energy in the food's chemical bonds to chemical bonds in our molecules. During this conversion, most energy is lost as heat (which is why our bodies are warm!)."}
{"input": "Acid deposition most severely affects amphibian species because amphibians A. do not care for their young B. are not mammals C. need to live in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats D. seldom reproduce", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Acid deposition affects species by damaging habitats and by reducing or contaminating food sources through uptake of toxic levels of metals. Species such as amphibians, which require both aquatic and terrestrial environments, are most at risk. For example, in the acid-sensitive areas of eastern Canada, 16 of the 17 amphibian species have more than 50 percent of their ranges affected by acidic deposition. Monitoring amphibian populations may provide a biological indication of changes in acid deposition."}
{"input": "All of the following are internal costs of an automobile EXCEPT A. car insurance B. fuel C. pollution and health care costs D. raw materials and labor", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Internal costs are all the costs that are incurred by the buyer and seller of the item in question. For example, the cost of gasoline and the purchase price of the car are both buyer costs. The costs of metal, plastics, employee salaries, and plant maintenance are internal costs of the seller. Choice (C) is the correct answer because it is not an internal cost, but an external one; it is a cost paid by society. Health care costs that arise as a result of air pollution and the cost of building roads are both external costs."}
{"input": "Scrubbers are devices installed in smokestacks to A. reduce the amount of materials such as SO2 in the smoke they discharge B. clean out the stack so smoke can move rapidly upward C. reduce the amount of sulfur in coal before it is burned D. reduce the amount of toxic ash produced", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Scrubbers are devices that are installed in smokestacks in order to reduce the amount of pollutants that rise up the stack. They extract the pollutants in different ways: by trapping dust in filter material, using cyclonic air motion to concentrate dust in one area, or spraying water in the stack to trap both dust and gases that are water-soluble. Choice (B) is simply not the best answer; (C) occurs before smoke is produced; and (D) is simply untrue—in fact, the amount of ash is greater when scrubbers are in place because scrubbers trap materials."}
{"input": "After ore is mined, the unusable part that remains is placed in piles called A. overburden B. seam waste C. leachate D. tailings", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: After ore is mined, the unusable parts that are placed into piles that are called tailings. This is a question that you'd either know the answer to or you wouldn't. Remember that if you come to a question like this and have absolutely no idea which choice is correct, pick your favorite letter and move on. You can also circle it and come back to it in the next pass—maybe you'll remember the answer if you give your subconscious mind a chance to do its thing. Let's look at the other answer choices: (A), overburden, is the rock that's removed from the ground in the surface mining of coal, so it's wrong. We made up (B), we hope you didn't choose it! Choice (C), leachate, is the liquid that percolates through a mine or landfill."}
{"input": "All of the following are examples of externalities EXCEPT A. a construction worker purchasing an automobile that reduces his commute time to work. B. a factory producing air pollution that leads to acid rain in the neighboring forest area. C. the construction of a new football stadium leading to increased income for local businesses. D. driving electric and hybrid vehicles reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: An externality is an unanticipated consequence experienced by unrelated third parties. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are all examples of externalities. Choice (A) is not an externality because the effect is experienced by a related party (the construction worker who purchased the automobile)."}
{"input": "Which fuel contains the greatest amount of sulfur? A. Wood B. Natural gas C. Nuclear reactor fuel rods D. Coal", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The fossil fuel coal is sedimentary rock that's derived from decayed and fossilized plant and animal materials. During the fossilization process, sulfur is incorporated into the rocks; this sulfur comes from bacteria that perform the decomposition of the material, as well as from the decaying material itself. None of the other fuels contains as much of the element sulfur (S)."}
{"input": "Biological reserves are areas that allow countries to A. concentrate agricultural production in one area B. set aside critical habitats to ensure the survival of species C. control the flow of rivers and storm waters D. provide grazing land in order to ensure economic growth", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Choice (B) is the best definition of a biological reserve. These reserves are areas of habitat that are crucial to the survival of species. Strictly speaking, a biological reserve is an area of land and/or water designated as having protected status for purposes of preserving certain biological features. Reserves are managed primarily to safeguard these features and provide opportunities for research into the problems underlying the management of natural sites and of vegetation and animal populations. Regulations are usually imposed that control public access and prevent people from disturbing these areas. All other answer choices would lower the biodiversity of an area."}
{"input": "Which of the following countries has the shortest population doubling time? A. Denmark B. Australia C. United States D. Kenya", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The doubling time is the amount of time it takes for the population of a country to double. The country with the shortest doubling time is the country with the most rapid population growth. Among the answer choices, Kenya is the only one with a rapid population growth, so (D) is the correct answer. Denmark is experiencing zero growth, so (A) is wrong. The United States and Australia are experiencing slow growth, so (B) and (C) are also incorrect."}
{"input": "Which of the following processes leads to an increase in atmospheric water content? A. Precipitation B. Transpiration C. Infiltration D. Condensation", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Transpiration is the evaporation of water from plants into the air. This process increases the atmospheric water content.

{"input": "Since 2000, the atmospheric concentration of which of the following has decreased as a result of anthropogenic activity? A. Methane B. Carbon dioxide C. Chlorofluorocarbons D. Nitrous oxide", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: In 1987, the Montreal protocol was signed. The protocol called for the worldwide end of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) production. As the result of the protocol, the atmospheric concentration of CFCs has decreased, allowing for the ozone hole to recover. Choice (C) is correct. Choices (A), (B), and (D) are all greenhouse gases that have been continuallyincreasingin atmospheric concentration, not decreasing."}
{"input": "During a society's postindustrial state, the population will exhibit A. rapid growth with a low birth rate and high death rate B. slow growth with a slowing birth rate and a low death rate C. rapid growth with a high birth rate and low death rate D. zero growth with a low birth rate and low death rate", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: In the postindustrial state, the population has reached its carrying capacity and will exhibit a zero growth rate, or even drop below a zero growth rate."}
{"input": "Which of the following is NOT a disadvantage of old-style landfills? A. They generate gases that can be recovered and used as fuel. B. Bad odors come from these landfills. C. Toxic wastes leach into ground water. D. Subsidence of the land after the landfill is filled.", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Methane is a useful biofuel that is produced from the decomposition of organic molecules in a landfill. This gas can be trapped, purified, and used to power vehicles. All of the other effects that are listed are undesirable results of the existence of old landfills."}
{"input": "The international treaty concerning endangered species (CITES) has tried to protect endangered species by taking which of the following steps? A. Making more countries keep these species in zoos B. Paying the debts of member countries in order to relieve the pressure to sell endangered species C. Developing a list of endangered species and prohibiting trade in those species D. Restoring endangered habitats", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The CITES treaty (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) entered into force in 1975. It was first discussed in the late 1960s when people recognized that there was no way to internationally protect endangered or threatened species. CITES is international in scope and is designed to halt the killing of endangered or threatened species for food, collection, or medicinal purposes by penalizing those who collect, trade, or buy those species."}
{"input": "In 2000, the population of Country A was 50,000. If Country A has a constant birth rate of 33 per 1,000 and a constant death rate of 13 per 1,000, when will the population of Country A equal 200,000? A. 2035 B. 2050 C. 2070 D. 2105", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The growth rate of Country A is equal to its birth rate subtracted by its death rate: 33 births per 1,000 – 13 deaths per 1,000 = an increase of 20 persons per 1,000, or a growth rate of 2%. The doubling time can be calculated using the Rule of 70: 70 divided by 2 is equal to 35. This means that it takes 35 years for the population of Country A to double. In order for the population of Country A to reach 200,000, the population needs to double twice. This would take 70 years, so the answer is 2070, which is (C)."}
{"input": "Salt intrusion into freshwater aquifers, beach erosion, and the disruption of costal fisheries are all possible results of which of the following? A. Rising ocean levels as a result of global warming B. More solar ultraviolet radiation on the Earth C. More chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere D. Reduced rates of photosynthesis", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: Increased ocean levels is the most logical cause of the phenomena listed in the question. The increase is due to two main factors: the first factor is that as water warms, it expands. This is known as thermal expansion. Secondly, as the average global temperature increases, glaciers and other ice formations will melt; this will increase the volume of the world's oceans. All of the answer choices represent events that could be caused by an increase in the volume of the world's oceans."}
{"input": "The chemical actions that produce compost would best be described as A. photosynthesis B. augmentation C. respiration D. decomposition", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Compost is formed from decaying plants and other organic material. In the composting process, both bacteria and fungi decompose large organic molecules into smaller molecules. Compost can then be used to fortify and condition soil. While it might have been tempting, (C) is too general an answer, because all living organisms undergo respiration."}
{"input": "Which of the sources below would produce non-point source pollution? A. The smokestack of a factory B. A volcano C. A pipe leading into a river from a sewage treatment plant D. A large area of farmland near a river", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Non-point pollution sources are defined as pollution that comes from a broad, ill-defined area, such as a large area of farmland. Since most farmers in the area presumably fertilize their crops, you cannot point to one specific area as the only source. Choices (A) through (C) are all point sources of pollution."}
{"input": "A nation's gross domestic product represents A. the ability to provide health care B. the amount of goods it imports C. the amount of its economic output D. the quality of its environment", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Choice (C) represents the standard definition of GDP.

{"input": "In sea water, carbon is mostly found in the form of A. phosphoric acid B. carbon disulfide C. bicarbonate ions D. methane gas", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: The bicarbonate ion (HCO3–) is produced when atmospheric carbon dioxide reacts with ocean water. Bicarbonate ions act as a buffer in seawater and allow the pH to be relatively stable, ranging between 7.5 and 8.5. Choice (A), phosphoric acid, contains no carbon atoms. Neither methane nor carbon disulfide exist in large quantities in, so (B) and (D) are wrong as well."}
{"input": "Acid rain and snow harm some areas more than others because certain areas A. have more bacteria in the soil than others B. have a lesser ability to neutralize the acids C. are at a higher elevation than the unaffected areas D. are closer to lakes than are the unaffected areas", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Choice (B) is correct because areas rich in limestone or other basic minerals can neutralize the acid deposition products. Limestone is composed mostly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This dissolves in water to form bicarbonate ions (HCO3–), which act as the buffering agent."}
{"input": "Which one of the following does NOT store a great deal of phosphorus? A. Rocks B. Water C. Atmosphere D. Living organisms", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Atmosphere (C) is the only answer choice that does not store significant amounts of phosphorus. Phosphorus is rarely present in gases. Additionally, it is relatively insoluble in water. It is found most frequently in rocks and minerals."}
{"input": "The addition of oxygen to the early Earth's atmosphere most likely occurred through the process of A. volcanic outgassing B. photosynthesis C. meteorite impact D. respiration by animals", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: The current hypothesis for the formation of large volumes of oxygen in the atmosphere is called the autotrophic hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, the early atmosphere had almost no O2. It was not until the evolution of photosynthesis that the levels of O2increased. As for the other answer choices, volcanic outgas mostly consists of oxides of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen sulfide; meteorites could not carry gases effectively; and animals produce CO2not O2."}
{"input": "Scientists use which of the following to estimate environmental risks to humans? A. II only B. I and II only C. I and III only D. I, II, and III", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: \"Animal studies\" refers to tests conducted on animals in laboratories, under controlled conditions. For example, this type of study is used to determine the dosage of a chemical that will kill 50 percent of a test population (LD50). Epidemiological studies are done by examining human populations exposed to certain risks (for example, smoking). Statistical probabilities quantify the likelihood that a given event will occur."}
{"input": "Which of the following best describes the type of pollution at mile 0? A. Point source B. Acid deposition C. Secondary pollutant D. Deep well", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: This is a single dose of the pollutant from a point source. You can determine this because the BOD drops off, meaning that the pollutant is being diluted by unpolluted water. Choice (B) is incorrect because it is a secondary air pollutant. Choice (C) is a class of pollutants that result from the mixing of combustion products in the atmosphere. Choice (D), deep well, is a location where toxic materials are stored deep underground. It is unlikely that it would pollute the stream."}
{"input": "The BOD at mile 12 is approximately A. 700 ppm B. 220 ppm C. 200 ppm D. 175 ppm", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: This question tests your ability to estimate based on the graph. Look carefully at the axes and scale. It is helpful to use your pencil to draw a line from the 12-mile mark in thex-axis up to the line, and then another line from that point to they-axis. You should be able to estimate 220 ppm (parts per million). Choice (A) is too high an estimate. Choices (C) and (D) are estimates that are too low."}
{"input": "The BOD test is designed to directly measure A. how much light can pass to the bottom of the stream B. the amount of nitrates in the water C. the amounts of coliform bacteria D. the rate at which oxygen is being consumed by microorganisms", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The BOD, or Biological Oxygen Demand, test determines the rate at which microorganisms take oxygen out of the water. This test is an estimate of the amount of biodegradable organic matter in the water and is an indirect indicator of water quality. Choice (A) is the turbidity test—the number of particles that scatter light in the water. Choice (B), nitrates, are important plant nutrients and are measured by tests that can quantitatively determine the concentration of the chemical ions. Choice (C), coliform bacteria, live in the intestinal tracts of animals and are an indication that fecal matter is in the water. This is not a BOD test because the coliform test measures the number of living cells, not their biological activity."}
{"input": "Anaerobic bacteria, sludge worms, and fungi are most likely to be found in which part of this stream? A. 0 to 5 miles B. 10 to 15 miles C. 15 to 20 miles D. 25 to 30 miles", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: You should recognize that the three organisms live in conditions with very low oxygen content. Looking carefully at the graph, you will see that the BOD is highest from 0 to 5 miles. Because the BOD is highest here, the amount of oxygen in the water is the lowest. Remember, high demand means low amounts of oxygen in the water! Choices (B), (C), and (D) are areas where the BOD is low—so there is more oxygen in the water. The three listed organisms do not live in areas of high oxygen content."}
{"input": "Riparian zones are important parts of lands because they are A. the area where most cattle feed when they graze B. an area of diverse habitats along the banks of rivers C. important buffers against wind D. areas where varying amounts of light cause different layers of plant growth", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Choice (B) is a correct definition of a riparian zone. It is an ecotone between a river or stream and land. Riparian zones act as buffer areas, absorbing excess water and pollutants that travel from the land to the water. Choice (A) defines rangeland; (C) is the role of a tree line; (D) is the understory of a forest."}
{"input": "Which of the following is a disadvantage of fish farming? A. It can allow for genetic engineering, which leads to bigger yields. B. It is very profitable. C. It can lead to large die-offs due to disease. D. It can reduce the pressure to harvest wild species.", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: This is the only answer that is a disadvantage.

{"input": "The form of nitrogen that plants can use directly is A. nitrates B. nitrites C. N2 gas D. methane", "output": "Correct Answer: A Explanation: There is a little saying that might help you remember which form of nitrogen is utilized by plants. A mnemonic is: \"The plants ate the nitrate.\" Notice that nitrate has the same last three letters asate.Choices (B) and (C) are parts of the nitrogen cycle, but are not absorbed by plants. Choice (D) is not a nitrogen-containing compound."}
{"input": "Which of the following best describes the effects of a thermal inversion? A. Cold ocean water moves to the surface and warm water sinks. B. Warm, polluted air rises and mixes with cool upper air, and pollutants escape. C. Warm river water cools when it enters the ocean. D. Polluted air at the surface cannot rise because it is blocked by warm air above it.", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Thermal inversions occur when a warm layer of air prevents polluted air from rising up over a city. Normally, cool upper air allows the warm air to rise, and the pollutants are dispersed along with the warm air. When an inversion occurs, the upper air is warmer and the polluted air cannot rise. This traps the pollution close to the Earth's surface. Choices (A) and (C) both deal with water; thermal inversions are atmospheric phenomena. Choice (B) is the pattern in a normal atmosphere."}
{"input": "Shifting taxes to tax pollution and waste rather than taxing the cost of products will allow people to A. maximize profit B. increase the tax base in a city C. use tax money for local schools D. shift to a pattern of more sustainable development", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Choice (D) is the correct answer, based on the principles of an environmentally sustainable economy.

{"input": "The map shows an area of eutrophication (\"dead zone\") in the Gulf of Mexico. Which of the following accurately describes the chain of events leading to its formation? A. Mississippi River carries fertilizer and sewage into the Gulf—phytoplankton and zooplankton experience major population decrease—detritus from dead phytoplankton and zooplankton feeds bacteria at sea floor—bacteria metabolize available oxygen while decomposing this food source B. Mississippi River carries fertilizer and sewage into the Gulf—phytoplankton and zooplankton experience population explosion—less detritus from dead phytoplankton and zooplankton to feed bacteria at sea floor—bacteria produce less oxygen while decomposing this food source C. Mississippi River carries fertilizer and sewage into the Gulf—phytoplankton and zooplankton experience major population decrease—less detritus from dead phytoplankton and zooplankton to feed bacteria at sea floor—bacteria produce less oxygen while decomposing this food source D. Mississippi River carries fertilizer and sewage into the Gulf—phytoplankton and zooplankton experience population explosion—detritus from dead phytoplankton and zooplankton feeds bacteria at sea floor—bacteria metabolize available oxygen while decomposing this food source", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The dead zone was created because of the fertilizer and sewage that the Mississippi River carries into the Gulf. Since the water containing these pollutants is very nutrient-rich and warm, it creates a food source for phytoplankton and zooplankton in the surface waters there, creating a population explosion among these organisms. Since there is then more detritus from dead phytoplankton and zooplankton feeds, the bacteria at the sea floor have abundant food for decomposition, but they metabolize and use up the available oxygen while doing so, creating the hypoxic (\"dead\") zone. Choice (D) correctly captures this chain of events."}
{"input": "Which of the following is NOT an effect of the presence of this \"dead zone\"? A. Collapse of the shrimp and shellfish industries in the area B. Nothing that depends on oxygen can grow in the zone from May to September C. Reproductive problems in fish involving decreased size of reproductive organs, low egg counts, and lack of spawning D. Mass migration of fish to other areas of the Gulf", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: The hypoxic zone stays in place from May to September, when cooler and wetter weather helps break it up: during this time, so little oxygen is available that most organisms can't grow there, (B). Another effect is reproductive problems for fish who develop in low-oxygen areas near the dead zone, (C). Both of these contribute to the decline of the fishing industries that depend on ocean life there, (A). While it is easy to imagine that fish would simply migrate, many are simply rendered unconscious and die quickly, and habitat loss kills others, (D)."}

In 1992, the protocol was updated in a meeting in Denmark to accelerate the phasing out of ozone-depleting chemicals. Choice (B), Kyoto Protocol, dealt with CO2levels. Choice (C), CAA, affected the United States only. Choice (D), The Rio Earth Summit, dealt with many global environmental problems, but Montreal was specific to ozone depletion."}
{"input": "DDT is an insecticide sprayed to control insects. Years after it was introduced, DDT was found in large predatory birds, such as the osprey. Which of the following processes caused the DDT to be found in the osprey? A. I only B. III only C. I and III only D. I, II, and III", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Bioaccumulation is the process by which chemicals remain and accumulate in the bodies of animals. These chemicals come from food and cannot be metabolically removed from the tissues. Generally, they are fat-soluble. Biomagnification occurs when a predator eats several organisms and each individual prey has a bit of the chemical in its tissues. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification work together to increase the levels of toxic materials in the bodies of animals. Bioremediation is the removal of toxic compounds by living organisms."}

{"input": "A farmer stops farming a certain tract of land, and small bushes soon grow there. The land then progresses to the deciduous tree stage. This process is known as A. pioneer succession B. wetland succession C. secondary succession D. primary succession", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Secondary succession is defined as succession that begins on land that was disturbed by an (often human) activity. Primary succession begins on land that was exposed to abiotic factors; e.g., when lava cools or when a glacier leaves an area."}
{"input": "According to the diagram, low species diversity and small-sized plants are characteristics of which stage of succession? A. I only B. II only C. III only D. I and III only", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: By definition, early-stage species are small and exhibit little diversity. At the early stages of succession, an area is populated mostly byr-selected organisms. Middle stage and late-stage communities generally have larger adult species and many moreK-selected organisms."}
{"input": "Ozone depletion is occurring most rapidly in the Earth's polar regions because A. the atmosphere is thicker at the poles, so ozone destruction is easier to observe B. large amounts of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can accumulate on ice crystals formed in the cold atmosphere C. the upper atmosphere winds form a pattern of high- and low-pressure systems that can cause the destruction of ozone D. the solar UV radiation is stronger at the poles, promoting the breakdown of ozone", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Steady winds create polar vortices, which can trap large amounts of CFCs from other parts of the world. In winter, ice crystals form in the upper atmosphere. The CFCs accumulate on the crystals, and when the polar spring returns, the crystals melt and release the CFCs. Then, the free Cl breaks down the ozone."}
{"input": "Smaller forest fires are beneficial to forests for all of the following reasons EXCEPT A. combustion of dried leaves or needles, which reduces the threat of large fires B. burning the crowns of trees C. germinating seeds of certain plant species D. making burned matter available as a nutrient", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: The crown is the top, or most rapidly growing part, of the tree. In very large forest fires, the crowns of the trees burn, weakening or killing the trees. Leaves or needles burning in smaller fires take away fuel for future fires and break down matter to ash, which provides nutrients for the trees. Fires are also responsible for allowing the seeds of many plant species to germinate."}
{"input": "What are the negative impacts of dams on ecosystems? A. I only B. III only C. I and III only D. I, II, and III", "output": "Correct Answer: C Explanation: Dams can have detrimental impacts on local environments and populations.

For (D), radioactive materials do not form fossil fuels. Coal and other fossil fuels all formed from plants and other organic material that lived some 300 to 400 million years ago. These plants and animals decayed, and the remains were exposed to tremendous pressures and temperatures."}
{"input": "All of the following are negative impacts of food production EXCEPT A. increased erosion B. air pollution from fossil fuels C. bioaccumulation of pesticides D. lower death rates", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Countries that have more food will have healthier children and adult populations, and thus they will have lower death rates. Increased food production results in increased erosion because after crops are harvested, the bare ground is more readily eroded. Approximately 90 percent of applied pesticides do not reach their targets and can end up in water and soil. The heavy use of large machinery means that more plants can be harvested, but these machines are powered by fossil fuels."}
{"input": "Soils found in mid-latitude grasslands would be most accurately described as having A. a high acid content with little organic matter B. a deep layer of humus and decayed plant material C. a layer of permafrost right below the O-horizon D. a high content of iron oxides and very little moisture", "output": "Correct Answer: B Explanation: Mid-latitude grasslands alternate between rapid growth and drought. Drought and cold winter temperatures permit only a small amount of decomposition each year, which leads to the accumulation of organic matter. In North America, this layer can be more than 30 m thick. Choice (A) describes coniferous forest soils, (C) is arctic tundra, and (D) describes desert soil."}
{"input": "All of the following are useful methods for reducing domestic water use EXCEPT A. using low-flow shower heads B. using low-flush-volume toilets C. fixing leaks as soon as they start D. lowering the temperature of the water heater", "output": "Correct Answer: D Explanation: Choice (D) might reduce the cost of heating the water, but it will not slow down water consumption.
