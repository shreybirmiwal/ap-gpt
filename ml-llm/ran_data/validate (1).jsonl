{"input": "Which of the following is a direct economic advantage associated with aquaculture? A) Aquaculture breeds genetically modified fish to increase the amount of biodiversity in the population. B) Aquaculture reduces the number of fishing operations in an area. C) Aquaculture produces large amounts of seafood for human purchase and consumption year-round. D) Aquaculture requires large bodies of water for its operations.", "output": "c) Aquaculture produces large amounts of seafood for human purchase and consumption year-round."}
{"input": "Which of the following statements is true of aquatic biomes? A) Freshwater and marine biomes are evenly distributed on Earth.B) Freshwater biomes are a vital source of drinking water.C) Freshwater biomes supply a greater portion of Earth's oxygen than marine biomes.D) Marine biomes include streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes.", "output": "B)Freshwater biomes are a vital source of drinking water."}
{"input": "Which of the following best describes legislation that could be used to address problems with overfishing?A) The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITESCITES ) uses trade rules to protect commercially valuable species.B) The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of pollutants in surface waters. C) The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRARCRA ) provides guidelines for the management of aquatic resources. D) The Delaney Clause of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regulates the harvesting of fish species for human consumption.", "output": "C) The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRARCRA ) provides guidelines for the management of aquatic resources."}
{"input": "Which of the following is an unintended environmental consequence of aquaculture? A) Meeting an increasing demand for seafoodB) Decreasing the prevalence of disease in nearby wild fishC) Contamination of surrounding water by organic wasteD) High initial cost of facility", "output": "A) Meeting an increasing demand for seafood"}
{"input": "Coral bleaching can be hazardous to some fish species becauseA) coral reefs provide unique habitats for fishB) decomposition of corals can lead to ocean acidificationC) the dead corals attract predators that feed on the fishD) the corals are the primary source of O2O2 in ocean water", "output": "B) decomposition of corals can lead to ocean acidification"}
{"input": "One way that consumers can help prevent a decrease in the number of fish species that are experiencing population declines is to A) help get laws passed that allow more fishing in areas that are not fished currently, therefore opening access to greater numbers of fish B) purchase fish harvested through the use of purse seining and long-lining methods so that only the largest fish are caught C) invest in companies that fish near coral reefs, which would take pressure off deep-sea species and eliminate the need for advances in technology D) eat fish that are caught using sustainable harvesting methods, therefore ensuring fish populations remain stable and reducing the amount bycatch harvested", "output": "D) eat fish that are caught using sustainable harvesting methods, therefore ensuring fish populations remain stable and reducing the amount bycatch harvested"}
